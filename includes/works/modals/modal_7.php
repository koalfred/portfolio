        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>To redevelop Themes & Variations' landing page into a modern, innovative and user-friendly site to allow all clients to access affiliated websites, being MusicplayOnline, as well as its downloads, store and workshops sites.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Planning Stage</h3>
      <p>Themes & Variations is a company based in Red Deer, Alberta, Canada, that creates engaging resources for elementary music teachers. This was my first project in the Themes & Variations company, and I had the honour to work on two versions of it; the screenshots showing the most recent version of the site as of July 2022. The first stage of the project was done in the summer of 2021, and involved using my HTML, CSS and PHP skills to edit the styling, layout and links of the page. The development of the second version was especially significant as I redeveloped the site based off of Adobe XD wireframes provided to me. I continuously made references to the latter to ensure that the site is pixel-perfect and user-friendly in all different kinds of dimensions. This was also the opportunity for me to create a CSS animation for the sliding text, adding to the dynamicity of the site.</p>
      <p>Users can now access affiliated sites as well as contact the company or access social media for more information.</p>
      <h3>Takeaway</h3>
      <p>This was a wonderful experience since this is one of the projects that particularly took my HTML, CSS and PHP skills to the next level. I have only gained even more confidence in the latter skills, a better understanding of the importance of HTML, CSS and PHP and learned a lot more about the different possibilities that they offer.</p>
