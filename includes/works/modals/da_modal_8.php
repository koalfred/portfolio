        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>To apply introductory Python concepts that I have learned to create a number guessing game which allows a player guess a number between 1 and 100. After the player correctly guesses the number, the number of attempts to guess the number, the mean, median and mode of the high scores would be displayed.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Takeaway</h3>
      <p>I found this project to be a great introduction to my data analysis journey. As I have had web development/programming experience before, Python was a relatively easy language for me to pick up. I had no idea that I was able to use Python to provide mathematical information such as the mean, median and mode, which made it more interesting.</p>
