        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>To use Python's pandas library to combine multiple datasets into one and analyze them.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Takeaway</h3>
      <p>This was my second favorite project, after the video game sales one. pandas is a very flexible library to can combine datasets from files such as CSV files. I was able to find out information from the given data such as the most popular songs, artists with the most songs, distribution of live and non-live songs as well as see if there were any relationships between certain variables such as popularity and danceability. I was able to use pandas to program such information through the use of charts such as scatter plots, bar charts and pie charts.</p>
