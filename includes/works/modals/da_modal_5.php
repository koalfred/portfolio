        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>To build a console application that loads existing inventory data from CSV files into a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy, to allow users to view existing records, add new items and backup the existing state of the database into a new backup CSV file.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Takeaway</h3>
      <p>This was probably the most challenging project in the Techdegree program, since it was not only my first time using SQLAlchemy, but it also took me longer to work on this project compared to others as I was still new to SQLAlchemy. However, I learned that it is an incredible way to sort and organize data and is like a combination of Python and SQL.</p>
