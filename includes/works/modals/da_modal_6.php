        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>To use Google Sheets to analyze Olympic data provided to me and compute statistics, filter and sort data.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Takeaway</h3>
      <p>As I had some familiarity with Microsoft Excel, I found it relatively easy to learn to use Google Sheets to analyze data, though I found it interesting that I was able to calculate the mean, median, mode, range, minimum and maximum values as well as the standard deviation of given data. I also learned an effective way to compute a visual chart, in my case being a stacked bar chart to show the number of gold, silver and bronze medals won, as well as for the first time, how to create a pivot table.</p>
