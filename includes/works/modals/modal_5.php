      <h3>Planning Stage</h3>
      <p>We brainstormed ideas as to what kind of content we wanted to include in our website, then listed the pages we wanted to include with content corresponding to the pages, through a content plan and wireframes.</p>

      <h3>Takeaway</h3>
      <p>HTML creates the foundation for creating a website’s content, whereas CSS is essential to the stylization of the website. SASS is an extension language to CSS that keeps the organization and layout of CSS code neat and organized. Adobe XD is a useful program that can be used to create wireframes for websites. GitHub is also a useful tool to use when all members of a group collaborate on a certain project at once, to see their changes, and avoid overriding conflicts. JavaScript is also useful as it increases the dynamicity of a website.</p>
