        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>To apply my knowledge of Python data structures, such as lists and dictionaries, to divide constants into groups of team players and form an analysis. The analysis contained information about teams such as the number of players, (in)experienced players, player names and guardians.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Takeaway</h3>
      <p>Lists and dictionaries are useful to organizing data in a more efficient way when using Python. This was also my first time importing constants, which were data already provided to me, to create an analysis program.</p>
