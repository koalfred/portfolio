          <h3>Objective</h3>
          <p>To create an accounts system for users to be able to access all sites affiliated with Themes & Variations.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Planning Stage</h3>
        <p>Though it was a brief project, it was definitely a challenging but a rewarding one as well. I had the chance to learn about the PHP framework Laravel through an online course for a couple of weeks, before applying my knowledge. The portion of the project that I worked on was a signup form, in which I was provided mockups on Adobe XD, and made use of them to ensure that the signup form is as pixel-perfect and user-friendly as possible.</p>
        <p>Being a Laravel project, there were different models, controllers, components, migrations....etc., used, and I got to use Sequel Ace/PHPMyAdmin to test data collection.</p>
        <p>Different examples of fields that were included were name fields, email fields, password fields, and optional checkboxes. I also incorporated error messages for validation purposes and loading screens on every page, as well as a success page redirecting a user back to the homepage.</p>
        <h3>Takeaway</h3>
        <p>Laravel is a dynamic framework that allows you to create databases in a fast and efficient way, while still making use of the usual PHP for loops and if statements. It also allows to take control of your projects in many different ways through the use of many elements.</p>
