        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>To use Python's pandas library/Jupyter Notebook to analyze pet shelter data to answer important questions for stakeholders.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Takeaway</h3>
      <p>It was my first time learning to use Jupyter Notebook and it was a very interesting experience. I learned that you were able to not only input code to prouce desirable outcomes, but use the markdown function to create text blocks in order to make your report readable. pandas is also a very useful and flexible software library to use to analyze data.</p>
