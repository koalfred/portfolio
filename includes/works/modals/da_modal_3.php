        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>To use pandas, Seaborn and Jupyter Notebook to program visual data charts and analyze video game data.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Takeaway</h3>
      <p>This was my favorite project in the Techdegree program. I loved how I was able to use pandas, Seaborn and Jupyter Notebook to create vibrant and easy-to-read data charts for this project, namely line graphs, pie charts and bar charts in order to present relevant data, such as the sales performance of video games, sales in different regions around the world, video game genres.....etc. I had no idea that you were able to produce such charts in order to allow a visually pleasant experience for clients who wish to read up on analyses that you create.</p>
