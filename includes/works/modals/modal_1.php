      <h3>Planning Stage</h3>
      <p>I used Powerpoint to create a content plan table showing the stages of the process that I used to create each work in the first place, along with description of what will be included in the home, about and contact page. The abovementioned program was also used to make a sitemap showing the structure of the website. It also included wireframes for each page shown in the mobile and desktop view. The logo and favicons were created using Photoshop.</p>

      <h3>Takeaway</h3>
      <p>HTML creates the foundation for creating a website’s content, whereas CSS is essential to the stylization of the website. SASS is an extension language to CSS that keeps the organization and layout of CSS code neat and organized. JavaScript is also useful as it increases the dynamicity of a website. PHP is a language that is essential for applications including login forms, contact forms, and storing information. It is also crucial to have a favicon and logo/wordmark, as well as SEO tags at the top of your html pages to market your brand.</p>
      <p>Overall, all languages are considered of great importance to anyone planning to work in front-end web development.</p>
