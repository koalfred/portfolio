        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>To gather and analyze data on 15 Oscar-winning movies using an API key.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Takeaway</h3>
      <p>Using API keys are very useful, as they can help you locate certain data in a fast and efficient way without having to hardcode certain information manually. Alike the past three most recent projects of the Techdegree, this was also great practice with the use of Jupyter Notebook and allowed me to further use pandas, Matplotlib and NumPy to analyze data. Through the use of (stacked) bar charts and scatter plots, I was able to find out information on movie data such as the most common movie genres, the number of awards and nominations per movie, box office performance as well as whether or not there were links between certain variables.</p>
      <p>I have also created a Google Slides presentation, found below, summarising all data that I collected.</p>
