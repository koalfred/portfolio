Rebel spaceships, \n                    striking from a hidden base, have won their first \n                    victory against the evil Galactic Empire.\n\n                    During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal \n                    secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the \n                    Death Star, an armored space station with enough \n                    power to destroy an entire planet.\n\n                    Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess \n                    Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of \n                    the stolen plans that can save her people and \n                    restore freedom to the galaxy...\n\n               The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total \n               eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny \n               silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers \n               from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed \n               by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer.

Both robots are \n               old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His \n               face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. \n               Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of \n               human proportions.

The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns \n               creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck \n               behind storage lockers.

His shaggy \n               hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable \n               lad with a prize-winning smile.\n\n               A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a \n               large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the \n               desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided \n               by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot \n               appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.  \n               A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and \n               he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his \n               utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying \n               the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired \n               Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet \n               above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the \n               tiny robot to follow him.\n\n<strong>                                     LUKE\n<\/strong>                         Hurry up! Come with me!

Luke throws his \n               arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps \n               into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum \n               madly.\n\n<strong>               INT.

This is \n               Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured \n               by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which \n               stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the \n               Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away \n               from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through \n               the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run \n               in a frenzied panic.\n\n<strong>               INT.

A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years \n               old) stands in front of Artoo.

Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock \n               canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he \n               goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for \n               a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.\n\n               In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall \n               and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little \n               further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a \n               pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the \n               narrow path.\n\n               The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until \n               suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out \n               of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages \n               one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his \n               back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then \n               off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller \n               than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they \n               cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and \n               their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be \n               seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave \n               the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down \n               the trail.\n\n<strong>               EXT.

They weld a \n               small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a \n               large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot \n               is sucked into the giant machine.\n\n               The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders \n               and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.\n\n<strong>               INT.

The narrow beam swings across rusty \n               metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and \n               maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper \n               and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end \n               of the chamber.\n\n<strong>               INT.

Old Ben moves in behind \n               Luke.\n\n<strong>                                     BEN\n<\/strong>                         This little one isn't worth the \n                         effort.

The rodent is cut \n               in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, \n               cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns \n               off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. \n               Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, \n               attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter \n               of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is \n               given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing \n               his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe.

MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN THRONE ROOM\n<\/strong>\n               Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main \n               temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners \n               are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the \n               beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly \n               march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From \n               one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired \n               Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to \n               an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the \n               whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other \n               dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is \n               dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.  \n               She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He \n               winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who \n               is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled \n               troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo \n               beeps with happiness.\n\n<strong>                                                                  FADE OUT:\n<\/strong>\n<strong>               END CREDITS OVER STARS\n<\/strong>\n<strong>                                         THE END\n<\/strong><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away&#8230; A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title.
