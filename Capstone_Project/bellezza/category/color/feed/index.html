<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...

               A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. 
               War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls 
               into infinity.

                    It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, 
                    striking from a hidden base, have won their first 
                    victory against the evil Galactic Empire.

                    During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal 
                    secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the 
                    Death Star, an armored space station with enough 
                    power to destroy an entire planet.

                    Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess 
                    Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of 
                    the stolen plans that can save her people and 
                    restore freedom to the galaxy...

               The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total 
               eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny 
               silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers 
               from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed 
               by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly 
               laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing 
               the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.

<strong>               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY
</strong>
               An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-
               D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way 
               through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are 
               old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His 
               face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. 
               Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of 
               human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic 
               surface of an Art Deco design.

               Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Did you hear that? They've shut down 
                         the main reactor. We'll be destroyed 
                         for sure. This is madness!

               Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in 
               the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         We're doomed!

               The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that 
               only another robot could understand.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         There'll be no escape for the Princess 
                         this time.

               Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as 
               loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment 
               are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         What's that?

<strong>               EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE
</strong>
               The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade 
               Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the 
               underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.

<strong>               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
</strong>
               The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a 
               tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and 
               a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make 
               their way into the smoke-filled corridor.

               In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with 
               laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns 
               creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck 
               behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers 
               who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered 
               arms and faces.

               An explosion hits near the robots.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         I should have known better than to 
                         trust the logic of a half-sized 
                         thermocapsulary dehousing assister...

               Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages 
               around the two hapless robots.

<strong>               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY
</strong>
               A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. 
               The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone 
               figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations 
               who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy 
               hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable 
               lad with a prize-winning smile.

               A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a 
               large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the 
               desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided 
               by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot 
               appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.  
               A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and 
               he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his 
               utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying 
               the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired 
               Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet 
               above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the 
               tiny robot to follow him.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Hurry up! Come with me! What are you 
                         waiting for?! Get in gear!

               The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and 
               smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his 
               arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps 
               into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum 
               madly.

<strong>               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY
</strong>
               The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his 
               way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is 
               Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured 
               by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which 
               stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the 
               Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away 
               from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through 
               the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run 
               in a frenzied panic.

<strong>               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
</strong>
               A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.  
               Artoo makes beeping sounds.

<strong>               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
</strong>
               Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is 
               nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel 
               soldiers can be heard in the distance.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?

               A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and 
               he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-
               filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years 
               old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, 
               dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting 
               something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little 
               robot joins his companion.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         At last! Where have you been?

               Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         They're heading in this direction. 
                         What are we going to do? We'll be 
                         sent to the spice mine of Kessel or 
                         smashed into who knows what!

               Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the 
               subhallway. Threepio chases after him.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Wait a minute, where are you going?

               Artoo responds with electronic beeps.

<strong>               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR
</strong>
               The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies 
               of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as 
               an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.

<strong>                                     IMPERIAL OFFICER
</strong>                         The Death Star plans are not in the 
                         main computer.

               Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles 
               in vain.

<strong>                                     VADER
</strong>                         Where are those transmissions you 
                         intercepted?

               Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.

<strong>                                     VADER
</strong>                         What have you done with those plans?

<strong>                                     REBEL OFFICER
</strong>                         We intercepted no transmissions. 
                         Aaah... This is a consular ship. 
                         Were on a diplomatic mission.

<strong>                                     VADER
</strong>                         If this is a consular ship... were 
                         is the Ambassador?

               The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the 
               Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a 
               gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp. 
               Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to 
               his troops.

<strong>                                     VADER
</strong>                         Commander, tear this ship apart until 
                         you've found those plans and bring 
                         me the Ambassador. I want her alive!

               The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.

<strong>               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY
</strong>
               The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the 
               stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia 
               Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her 
               eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds 
               of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the 
               troopers spots her.

<strong>                                     TROOPER
</strong>                         There she is! Set for stun!

               Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with 
               her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a 
               paralyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.

<strong>                                     TROOPER
</strong>                         She'll be all right. Inform Lord 
                         Vader we have a prisoner.

<strong>               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY
</strong>
               Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. 
               He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light 
               begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into 
               the cramped four-man pod.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Hey, you're not permitted in there. 
                         It's restricted. You'll be deactivated 
                         for sure..

               Artoo beeps something to him.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Don't call me a mindless philosopher, 
                         you overweight glob of grease! Now 
                         come out before somebody sees you.

               Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding 
               the mission he is about to perform.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Secret mission? What plans? What are 
                         you talking about? I'm not getting 
                         in there!

               Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps 
               and twangs angrily.

               A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris 
               through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and, 
               after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky 
               robot jumps into the lifepod.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         I'm going to regret this.

<strong>               INT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER
</strong>
               On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified 
               robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft.

<strong>                                     CHIEF PILOT
</strong>                         There goes another one.

<strong>                                     CAPTAIN
</strong>                         Hold your fire. There are no life 
                         forms. It must have been short-
                         circuited.

<strong>               INT. LIFEPOD
</strong>
               Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship.  
               Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         That's funny, the damage doesn't 
                         look as bad from out here.

               Artoo beeps an assuring response.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Are you sure this things safe?

<strong>               EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY
</strong>
               Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white 
               buildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty 
               empty street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to 
               get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist 
               at Luke as he flies past.

<strong>                                     WOMAN
</strong>                         I've told you kids to slow down!

<strong>               INT. POWER STATION - DAY
</strong>
               Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged 
               mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been 
               asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the 
               office, yelling wildly.

<strong>                                     FIXER
</strong>                         Did I hear a young noise blast through 
                         here?

<strong>                                     CAMIE
</strong>                         It was just wormie on another rampage.

               Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak 
               and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are 
               playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly, 
               handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy 
               city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics 
               of the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the 
               background.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?

               Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great 
               joy and emotion. They give each other a great bear hug.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         I didn't know you were back! When 
                         did you get in?

<strong>                                     BIGGS
</strong>                         Just now. I wanted to surprise you, 
                         hot shot. I thought you'd be here... 
                         certainly didn't expect you to be 
                         out working.
                              (he laughs)

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         The Academy didn't change you 
                         much...but you're back so soon? Hey, 
                         what happened, didn't you get your 
                         commission?

               Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.

<strong>                                     BIGGS
</strong>                         Of course I got it. Signed aboard 
                         The Rand Ecliptic last week. First 
                         mate Biggs Darklighter at your 
                         service...
                              (he salutes)
                         ...I just came to say good-bye to 
                         all you unfortunate landlocked 
                         simpletons.

               Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend 
               is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of 
               it.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         I almost forgot. There's a battle 
                         going on! Right here in our system. 
                         Come and look!

</strong><strong>               DAY
</strong>
               The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie 
               and The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. 
               Luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         There they are!

               Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain to 
               see something with the naked eye. Through the binoculars 
               Biggs sees two small silver specks.

<strong>                                     BIGGS
</strong>                         That's no battle, hot shot... they're 
                         just sitting there! Probably a 
                         freighter-tanker refueling.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         But there was a lot of firing 
                         earlier...

               Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the 
               building in the process. Luke grabs them.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Hey, easy with those...

<strong>                                     CAMIE
</strong>                         Don't worry about it, Wormie.

               The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs 
               his shoulders in resignation.

<strong>                                     FIXER
</strong>                         I keep telling you, the Rebellion is 
                         a long way from here. I doubt if the 
                         Empire would even fight to keep this 
                         system. Believe me Luke, this planet 
                         is a big hunk of nothing...

               Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The 
               group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about 
               Luke's ineptitude.

<strong>               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - HALLWAY
</strong>
               Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad 
               of armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is 
               brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly 
               marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader 
               emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard 
               at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.

<strong>                                     LEIA
</strong>                         Lord Vader, I should have known. 
                         Only you could be so bold. The 
                         Imperial Senate will not sit for 
                         this, when they hear you've attacked 
                         a diplomatic...

<strong>                                     VADER
</strong>                         Don't play games with me, Your 
                         Highness. You weren't on any mercy 
                         mission this time. You passed directly 
                         through a restricted system. Several 
                         transmissions were beamed to this 
                         ship by Rebel spies. I want to know 
                         what happened to the plans they sent 
                         you.

<strong>                                     LEIA
</strong>                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about. I'm a member of the Imperial 
                         Senate on a diplomatic mission to 
                         Alderaan...

<strong>                                     VADER
</strong>                         You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... 
                         and a traitor. Take her away!

               Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering 
               hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander 
               turns to Vader.

<strong>                                     COMMANDER
</strong>                         Holding her is dangerous. If word of 
                         this gets out, it could generate 
                         sympathy for the Rebellion in the 
                         senate.

<strong>                                     VADER
</strong>                         I have traced the Rebel spies to 
                         her. Now she is my only link to find 
                         their secret base!

<strong>                                     COMMANDER
</strong>                         She'll die before she tells you 
                         anything.

<strong>                                     VADER
</strong>                         Leave that to me. Send a distress 
                         signal and then inform the senate 
                         that all aboard were killed!

               Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander. 
               They stop and snap to attention.

<strong>                                     SECOND OFFICER
</strong>                         Lord Vader, the battle station plans 
                         are not aboard this ship! And no 
                         transmissions were made. An escape 
                         pod was jettisoned during the 
                         fighting, but no life forms were 
                         aboard.

               Vader turns to the Commander.

<strong>                                     VADER
</strong>                         She must have hidden the plans in 
                         the escape pod. Send a detachment 
                         down to retrieve them. See to it 
                         personally, Commander. There'll be 
                         no one to stop us this time.

<strong>                                     COMMANDER
</strong>                         Yes, sir.

<strong>               EXT. SPACE
</strong>
               The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the 
               planet Tatooine.

<strong>               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT
</strong>
               Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesas 
               meet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids 
               kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily 
               work their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in 
               the distance rests half buried in the sand.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         How did I get into this mess? I really 
                         don't know how. We seem to be made 
                         to suffer. It's our lot in life.

               Artoo answers with beeping sounds.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         I've got to rest before I fall apart. 
                         My joints are almost frozen.

               Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         What a desolate place this is.

               Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts 
               off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio 
               stops and yells at him.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Where are you going?

               A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small 
               robot.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Well, I'm not going that way. It's 
                         much too rocky. This way is much 
                         easier.

               Artoo counters with a long whistle.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         What makes you think there are 
                         settlements over there?

               Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Don't get technical with me.

               Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         What mission? What are you talking 
                         about? I've had just about enough of 
                         you! Go that way! You'll be 
                         malfunctioning within a day, you 
                         nearsighted scrap pile!

               Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the 
               direction of the vast dune sea.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         And don't let me catch you following 
                         me begging for help, because you 
                         won't get it.

               Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges 
               off in the direction of the towering mesas.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         No more adventures. I'm not going 
                         that way.

               Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant 
               mountains.

<strong>               EXT. TATOOINE - DUNE SEA
</strong>
               Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a 
               dune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless 
               miles.  He looks back in the direction of the now distant 
               rock mesas.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         That malfunctioning little twerp. 
                         This is all his fault! He tricked me 
                         into going this way, but he'll do no 
                         better.

               In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand 
               from his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of 
               reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving 
               towards him.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm 
                         saved!

               The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the 
               approaching transport.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Over here! Help! Please, help!

               Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer 
               and the others can be heard working inside.

                         ...so I cut off my power, shut down 
                         the afterburners and came in low on 
                         Deak's trail. I was so close I thought 
                         I was going to fry my instruments. 
                         As it was I busted up the Skyhopper 
                         pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty 
                         upset. He grounded me for the rest 
                         of the season. You should have been 
                         there... it was fantastic.

                         so... quiet.

               Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.

                         this, but you're the only one I can

               Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.

               power station.

<strong>               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET
</strong>
               The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange 
               foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures 
               fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock 
               canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he 
               goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for 
               a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.

               In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall 
               and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little 
               further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a 
               pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the 
               narrow path.

               The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until 
               suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out 
               of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages 
               one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his 
               back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then 
               off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller 
               than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they 
               cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and 
               their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be 
               seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave 
               the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down 
               the trail.

<strong>               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET
</strong>
               The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-
               like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a 
               small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a 
               large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot 
               is sucked into the giant machine.

               The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders 
               and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.

<strong>               INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA
</strong>
               It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo 
               switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles 
               around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty 
               metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and 
               maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper 
               and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end 
               of the chamber.

<strong>               INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA
</strong>
               Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the 
               middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various 
               shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation, 
               while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls 
               out from the gloom.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!

               A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.

<strong>               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET
</strong>
               The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent 
               twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain 
               ridge.

<strong>               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY
</strong>
               Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-
               buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. 
               A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.

<strong>                                     FIRST TROOPER
</strong>                         Someone was in the pod. The tracks 
                         go off in this direction.

               A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand 
               and gives it to the first trooper.

<strong>                                     SECOND TROOPER

<strong>               EXT. TATOOINE - DUNES
</strong>
               The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.

<strong>               INT. SANDCRAWLER
</strong>
               Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped 
               prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Wake up! Wake up!

               Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, 
               creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.  
               Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights 
               pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long 
               chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding 
               white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the 
               odd assortment of robots.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         We're doomed.

               A Jawa starts moving toward them.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Do you think they'll melt us down?

               Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this 
                         never end?

<strong>               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON
</strong>
               The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their 
               battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of 
               the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small 
               homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground 
               surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small 
               adobe block house.

               The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening 
               them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. 
               The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting 
               small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils 
               should be.

               Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, 
               a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are 
               sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully 
               inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- 
               shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little 
               Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales 
               pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.

               A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the 
               homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru 
               standing in the main courtyard.

<strong>                                     BERU
</strong>                         Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a 
                         translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.

</strong>                         It looks like we don't have much of 
                         a choice but I'll remind him.

               Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment 
               for sale with the Jawa leader.

                         Sir -- not in an environment such as 
                         this -- that's why I've also been 
                         programmed for over thirty secondary 
                         functions that...

</strong>                         What I really need is a droid that 
                         understands the binary language of 
                         moisture vaporators.

</strong>                         Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was 
                         programming binary load lifter... 
                         very similar to your vaporators. You 
                         could say...

</strong>                         Of course I can, sir. It's like a 
                         second language for me... I'm as 
                         fluent in Bocce...

                         both of them cleaned up before dinner.

</strong>                         But I was going into Toshi Station 
                         to pick up some power converters...

</strong>                         You can waste time with your friends 
                         when your chores are done. Now come 
                         on, get to it!

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         All right, come on! And the red one, 
                         come on. Well, come on, Red, let's 
                         go.

               As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back 
               into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep 
               and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained 
               by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.

               Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two 
               robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the 
               head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.

</strong>                         This R2 unit has a bad motivator. 
                         Look!

</strong>                              (to the head Jawa)
                         Hey, what're you trying to push on 
                         us?

               The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked 
               out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract 
               attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps 
               Luke on the shoulder.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                              (pointing to Artoo)
                         Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is 
                         in prime condition. A real bargain.

                         What about that blue one? We'll take 
                         that one.

               With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged 
               astro-droid for Artoo.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Yeah, take it away.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very 
                         pleased with that one, sir. He really 
                         is in first-class condition. I've 
                         worked with him before. Here he comes.

               Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots 
               trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Okay, let's go.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                              (to Artoo)
                         Now, don't you forget this! Why I 
                         should stick my neck out for you is 
                         quite beyond my capacity!

<strong>               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON
</strong>
               The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful 
               atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers 
               himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the 
               battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery 
               with a cord to his face.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Thank the maker! This oil bath is 
                         going to feel so good. I've got such 
                         a bad case of dust contamination, I 
                         can barely move!

               Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought 
               as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man 
               Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. 
               Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he 
               slams a wrench across the workbench.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is 
                         right. I'm never gonna get out of 
                         here!

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Is there anything I might do to help?

               Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains 
               and a tiny smile creeps across his face.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Well, not unless you can alter time, 
                         speed up the harvest, or teleport me 
                         off this rock!

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         I don't think so, sir. I'm only a 
                         droid and not very knowledgeable 
                         about such things. Not on this planet, 
                         anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm 
                         not even sure which planet I'm on.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Well, if there's a bright center to 
                         the universe, you're on the planet 
                         that it's farthest from.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         I see, sir.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Uh, you can call me Luke.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         I see, sir Luke.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                              (laughing)
                         Just Luke.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg 
                         relations, and this is my counterpart, 
                         Artoo-Detoo.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Hello.

               Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to 
               scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome 
               pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping 
               oil from his bronze body.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         You got a lot of carbon scoring here. 
                         It looks like you boys have seen a 
                         lot of action.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         With all we've been through, sometimes 
                         I'm amazed we're in as good condition 
                         as we are, what with the Rebellion 
                         and all.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         You know of the Rebellion against 
                         the Empire?

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         That's how we came to be in your 
                         service, if you take my meaning, 
                         sir.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Have you been in many battles?

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Several, I think. Actually, there's 
                         not much to tell. I'm not much more 
                         than an interpreter, and not very 
                         good at telling stories. Well, not 
                         at making them interesting, anyways.

               Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's 
               neck joint. He uses a larger pick.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Well, my little friend, you've got 
                         something jammed in here real good. 
                         Were you on a cruiser or...

               The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling 
               head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-
               dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being 
               projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a 
               rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly 
               lit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.

<strong>                                     LEIA
</strong>                         Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my 
                         only hope.

</strong>                         What's this?

               Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio 
               to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment 
               over and over.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         What is what?!? He asked you a 
                         question...
                              (pointing to Leia)
                         What is that?

               Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice 
               the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer 
               for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the 
               sentence fragment over and over.

<strong>                                     LEIA

                         You're my only hope.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely 
                         a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no 
                         mind.

               Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.

</strong>                         I think she was a passenger on our 
                         last voyage. A person of some 
                         importance, sir -- I believe. Our 
                         captain was attached to...

               Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic 
               squeaks and a whistle.

</strong>                         Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going 
                         to get us in trouble. It's all right, 
                         you can trust him. He's our new 
                         master.

               Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         He says he's the property of Obi-Wan 
                         Kenobi, a resident of these parts. 
                         And it's a private message for him. 
                         Quite frankly, sir I don't know what 
                         he's talking about. Our last master 
                         was Captain Antilles, but with what 
                         we've been through, this little R2 
                         unit has become a bit eccentric.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means 
                         old Ben Kenobi?

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         I beg your pardon, sir, but do you 
                         know what he's talking about?

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-
                         Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond 
                         the dune sea. He's kind of a strange 
                         old hermit.

               Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few 
               moments.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         I wonder who she is. It sounds like 
                         she's in trouble. I'd better play 
                         back the whole thing.

               Artoo beeps something to Threepio.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         He says the restraining bolt has 
                         short circuited his recording system. 
                         He suggests that if you remove the 
                         bolt, he might be able to play back 
                         the entire recording.

               Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't 
               really heard what Threepio has been saying.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're 
                         too small to run away on me if I 
                         take this off! Okay.

               Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off 
               Artoo's side.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         There you go.

               The princess immediately disappears...

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? 
                         Bring her back! Play back the entire 
                         message.

               Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in 
               embarrassment.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         What message? The one you're carrying 
                         inside your rusty innards!

               A women's voice calls out from another room.

<strong>                                     AUNT BERU
</strong>                         Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!

               Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning 
               robot.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         All right, I'll be right there, Aunt 
                         Beru.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to 
                         have picked up a slight flutter.

               Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and 
               hurries out of the room.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Well, see what you can do with him. 
                         I'll be right back.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                              (to Artoo)
                         Just you reconsider playing that 
                         message for him.

               Artoo beeps in response.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         No, I don't think he likes you at 
                         all.

               Artoo beeps.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         No, I don't like you either.

<strong>               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA
</strong>
               Luke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher 
               with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well-
               used kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls 
               of food and starts for the dining area.

               Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with 
               steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red 
               grain.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         You know, I think that R2 unit we 
                         bought might have been stolen.

<strong>                                     OWEN
</strong>                         What makes you think that?

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Well, I stumbled across a recording 
                         while I was cleaning him. He says he 
                         belongs to someone called Obi-Wan 
                         Kenobi.

               Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but 
               manages to control himself.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         I thought he might have meant old 
                         Ben. Do you know what he's talking 
                         about? Well, I wonder if he's related 
                         to Ben.

               Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.

<strong>                                     OWEN
</strong>                         That old man's just a crazy old 
                         wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take 
                         that R2 unit into Anchorhead and 
                         have its memory flushed. That'll be 
                         the end of it. It belongs to us now.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking 
                         for him?

<strong>                                     OWEN
</strong>                         He won't, I don't think he exists 
                         any more. He died about the same 
                         time as your father.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         He knew my father?

<strong>                                     OWEN
</strong>                         I told you to forget it. Your only 
                         concern is to prepare the new droids 
                         for tomorrow. In the morning I want 
                         them on the south ridge working out 
                         those condensers.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Yes, sir. I think those new droids 
                         are going to work out fine. In fact, 
                         I, uh, was also thinking about our 
                         agreement about my staying on another 
                         season. And if these new droids do 
                         work out, I want to transmit my 
                         application to the Academy this year.

               Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress 
               it.

<strong>                                     OWEN
</strong>                         You mean the next semester before 
                         harvest?

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Sure, there're more than enough 
                         droids.

<strong>                                     OWEN
</strong>                         Harvest is when I need you the most. 
                         Only one more season. This year we'll 
                         make enough on the harvest so I'll 
                         be able to hire some more hands. And 
                         then you can go to the Academy next 
                         year.

               Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle.

<strong>                                     OWEN
</strong>                         You must understand I need you here, 
                         Luke.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         But it's a whole 'nother year.

<strong>                                     OWEN
</strong>                         Look, it's only one more season.

               Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Yeah, that's what you said last year 
                         when Biggs and Tank left.

<strong>                                     AUNT BERU
</strong>                         Where are you going?

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         It looks like I'm going nowhere. I 
                         have to finish cleaning those droids.

               Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen 
               mechanically finishes his dinner.

<strong>                                     AUNT BERU
</strong>                         Owen, he can't stay here forever. 
                         Most of his friends have gone. It 
                         means so much to him.

<strong>                                     OWEN
</strong>                         I'll make it up to him next year. I 
                         promise.

<strong>                                     AUNT BERU
</strong>                         Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He 
                         has too much of his father in him.

<strong>                                     OWEN
</strong>                         That's what I'm afraid of.

<strong>               EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD
</strong>
               The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a 
               distant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few 
               moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the 
               homestead.

<strong>               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE
</strong>
               Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in 
               sight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt 
               similar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the 
               box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a 
               short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         What are you doing hiding there?

               Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in 
               sight.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't 
                         deactivate me. I told him not to go, 
                         but he's faulty, malfunctioning; 
                         kept babbling on about his mission.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Oh, no!

               Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio.

<strong>               EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD
</strong>
               Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead 
               and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro-
               robot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the 
               salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his 
               electrobinoculars.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         That R2 unit has always been a 
                         problem. These astro-droids are 
                         getting quite out of hand. Even I 
                         can't understand their logic at times.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere 
                         in sight. Blast it!

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go 
                         after him?

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         It's too dangerous with all the 
                         Sandpeople around. We'll have to 
                         wait until morning.

               Owen yells up from the homestead plaza.

<strong>                                     OWEN
</strong>                         Luke, I'm shutting the power down 
                         for the night.

                         minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.

               He takes one final look across the dim horizon.

</strong>
               Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of 
               the open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling of 
               Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead.

<strong>                                     OWEN
</strong>                         Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be 
                         loafing now!

<strong>               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN
</strong>
               The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru 
               prepares the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff.

<strong>                                     OWEN
</strong>                         Have you seen Luke this morning?

</strong>                         He said he had some things to do 
                         before he started today, so he left 
                         early.

<strong>                                     OWEN
</strong>                         Uh? Did he take those two new droids 
                         with him?

</strong>                         Well, he'd better have those units 
                         in the south range repaired be midday 
                         or there'll be hell to pay!

               The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio 
               pilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast 
               wasteland.

               Luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something 
               in the motor compartment.

                         How's that.

               Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the 
               wind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.

                         how that R2 unit could have come 
                         this far. We must have missed him. 
                         Uncle Owen isn't going to take this 
                         very well.

                         it was my fault.

                         only deactivate you for a day or 
                         so...

                         if you hadn't removed his restraining 
                         bolt...

</strong>                         Wait, there's something dead ahead 
                         on the scanner. It looks like our 
                         droid... hit the accelerator.

<strong>               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY
</strong>
               From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen 
               gliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground 
               two weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert 
               cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the 
               marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle 
               and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs 
               the gun before it can be fired.

               The Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes called, 
               speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an 
               animated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in 
               the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain.

<strong>               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - CANYON
</strong>
               The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied 
               to a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large 
               as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, 
               and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders 
               mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs 
               and ride off down the rugged bluff.

<strong>               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR
</strong>
               The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke, 
               with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands 
               before little Artoo.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Hey, whoa, just where do you think 
                         you're going?

               The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses 
               menacingly behind the little runaway.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Master Luke here is your rightful

                         Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't 
                         talk to me about your mission, either. 
                         You're fortunate he doesn't blast 
                         you into a million pieces right here.

                         only hope we can get back before 
                         Uncle Owen really blows up.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO

                         I think you should deactivate the 
                         little fugitive until you've gotten 
                         him back to your workshop.

</strong>                         No, he's not going to try anything.

               Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic 
               whistles and screams.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         What's wrong with him now?

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Oh my... sir, he says there are 
                         several creatures approaching from 
                         the southeast.

               Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's 
                         have a look. Come on.

<strong>               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY
</strong>
               Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and 
               scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the 
               two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young 
               adventurer.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         There are two Banthas down there but 
                         I don't see any... wait a second, 
                         they're Sandpeople all right. I can 
                         see one of them now.

               Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his 
               electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of 
               his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, 
               gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled 
               and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be 
               heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles 
               down the side of the mountain.

               The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed 
               gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in 
               the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block 
               the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. 
               The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced 
               to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands 
               over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible 
               shrieking laugh.

<strong>               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY
</strong>
               Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in 
               the rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the 
               inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the 
               speeder.  The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts 
               and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then 
               everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan 
               is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the 
               Sandpeople fleeing in terror.

               Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight 
               swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even 
               closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and 
               leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and 
               weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating 
               eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes 
               as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a 
               slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.

<strong>                                     BEN
</strong>                         Hello there! Come here my little 
                         friend. Don't be afraid.

               Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and 
               begins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand on 
               Luke's forehead and he begins to come around.

<strong>                                     BEN
</strong>                         Don't worry, he'll be all right.

                         in one piece.

                         what brings you out this far?

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Oh, this little droid! I think he's 
                         searching for his former master... 
                         I've never seen such devotion in a 
                         droid before... there seems to be no 
                         stopping him. He claims to be the 
                         property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he 
                         a relative of yours? Do you know who 
                         he's talking about?

               Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.

<strong>                                     BEN
</strong>                         Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats

                         time... a long time.

                         he was dead.

                         name Obi-Wan since oh, before you 
                         were born.

               He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.

<strong>                                     BEN
</strong>                         I think we better get indoors. The

                         they will soon be back and in greater 
                         numbers.

               Luke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic 
               beep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.

<strong>               EXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY
</strong>
               Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins 
               to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and 
               Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half 
               buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off.

               Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then 
               flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally 
               the mechanical man's systems turn on.

                         of here before the Sandpeople return.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         I don't think I can make it. You go 
                         on, Master Luke. There's no sense in 
                         you risking yourself on my account. 
                         I'm done for.

               Artoo makes a beeping sound.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         No, you're not. What kind of talk is 
                         that?

               Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little 
               Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around 
               suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the 
               air.

<strong>               INT. KENOBI'S DWELLING
</strong>
               The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but 
               still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and 
               security. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as 
               old Ben sits thinking.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         No, my father didn't fight in the 
                         wars. He was a navigator on a spice 
                         freighter.

                         didn't hold with your father's ideals. 
                         Thought he should have stayed here 
                         and not gotten involved.

</strong>                         He was the best star-pilot in the 
                         galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I 
                         understand you've become quite a 
                         good pilot yourself. And he was a 
                         good friend. Which reminds me...

               Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.  
               As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the 
               restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.  
               Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the 
               table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle 
               with several electronic gadgets attached to it.

<strong>                                     BEN
</strong>                         I have something here for you. Your 
                         father wanted you to have this when 
                         you were old enough, but your uncle 
                         wouldn't allow it. He feared you 
                         might follow old Obi-Wan on some 
                         damned-fool idealistic crusade like 
                         your father did.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Sir, if you'll not be needing me, 
                         I'll close down for awhile.

</strong>                         Sure, go ahead.

               Ben hands Luke the saber.

                         weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy 
                         or as random as a blaster.

               Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out 
               about four feet and flickers there. The light plays across 
               the ceiling.

                         the Jedi Knights were the guardians 
                         of peace and justice in the Old 
                         Republic. Before the dark times, 
                         before the Empire.

               Luke hasn't really been listening.

                         to evil, helped the Empire hunt down

                         request to you in person, but my 
                         ship has fallen under attack and I'm 
                         afraid my mission to bring you to

               There is a little static and the transmission is cut short.  
               Old Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffs 
               on a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes.

               An Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like 
               battle station: the Death Star!

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM
</strong>
               Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black 
               conference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around 
               the room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, 
               is speaking.

<strong>                                     TAGGE
</strong>                         Until this battle station is fully 
                         operational we are vulnerable. The 
                         Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. 
                         They're more dangerous than you 
                         realize.

               The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.

<strong>                                     MOTTI
</strong>                         Dangerous to your starfleet, 
                         Commander, not to this battle station!

<strong>                                     TAGGE
</strong>                         The Rebellion will continue to gain 
                         a support in the Imperial Senate as 
                         long as....

               Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut 
               short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial 
               outland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally, 
               The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and 
               bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his 
               place at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind 
               him.

</strong>                         The Imperial Senate will no longer 
                         be of any concern to us. I've just 
                         received word that the Emperor has 
                         dissolved the council permanently. 
                         The last remnants of the Old Republic 
                         have been swept away.

</strong>                         That's impossible! How will the 
                         Emperor maintain control without the 
                         bureaucracy?

                         keep the local systems in line. Fear

                         Rebels have obtained a complete 
                         technical readout of this station, 
                         it is possible, however unlikely, 
                         that they might find a weakness and 
                         exploit it.

                         sad devotion to that ancient religion 
                         has not helped you conjure up the 
                         stolen data tapes, or given you 
                         clairvoyance enough to find the

               Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's

               The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas 
               Sandcrawler. Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble 
               and scattered bodies.

</strong>                         It looks like Sandpeople did this, 
                         all right. Look, here are Gaffi 
                         sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just... 
                         I never heard of them hitting anything 
                         this big before.

               Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.

                         think they did. These tracks are 
                         side by side. Sandpeople always ride 
                         single file to hide there numbers.

</strong>                         And these blast points, too accurate 
                         for Sandpeople. Only Imperial 
                         stormtroopers are so precise.

</strong>                         Why would Imperial troops want to 
                         slaughter Jawas?

               Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are 
               inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         If they traced the robots here, they 
                         may have learned who they sold them 
                         to. And that would lead them home!

               Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for 
               the speeder and jumps it.

</strong>                         Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous.

               Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the 
               burning Sandcrawler.

               Luke races across the wasteland in his battered Landspeeder.

</strong>
               The speeder roars up to the burning homestead. Luke jumps 
               out and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home. 
               Debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great 
               battle has taken place.

               Luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle. 
               Suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains. He is 
               stunned, and cannot speak. Hate replaces fear and a new 
               resolve comes over him.

               Imperial TIE fighter races toward the Death Star.

</strong>
               Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow 
               several Imperial guards to enter. Princess Leia's face is 
               filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a 
               giant black torture robot enters, followed by Darth Vader.

                         discuss the location of your hidden 
                         Rebel base.

               The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it 
               approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical 
               arms bearing a large hypodermic needle. The door slides shut 
               and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful. The muffled 
               screams of the Rebel princess are barely heard.

<strong>               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of 
               the Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the 
               dead.  Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to 
               him.

                         been killed, too, and the droids 
                         would be in the hands of the Empire.

                         want to learn the ways of the Force

               The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it 
               zooms across the desert. The speeder stops on a bluff 
               overlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazard 
               array of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes. A 
               harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. Luke adjusts 
               his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where 
               Ben is standing.

                         and villainy. We must be cautious.

               Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined 
               smile.

               The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat-
               hardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots. A Trooper 
               questions Luke.

               Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID while 
               Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice.

               The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina 
               on the outskirts of the spaceport. Various strange forms of 
               transport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are 
               parked outside the bar. A Jawa runs up and begins to fondle 
               the speeder.

               As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa 
               away.

               The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow 
               Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy 
               den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic 
               alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At 
               first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, 
               furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over 
               drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group 
               of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender 
               stops Luke and the robots.

<strong>                                     BARTENDER
</strong>                         We don't serve their kind here!

               Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many 
               outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's 
               drift.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         What?

<strong>                                     BARTENDER
</strong>                         Your droids. They'll have to wait 
                         outside. We don't want them here.

               Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the 
               Galactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures 
               along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare.

               Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Listen, why don't you wait out by 
                         the speeder. We don't want any 
                         trouble.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         I heartily agree with you sir.

               Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the 
               creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.

               Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage-
               looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with 
               fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur-
               covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.  
               Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, 
               and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a 
               sight to behold.

               Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times 
               during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets 
               out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit 
               disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between 
               Ben and the giant Wookiee.

               Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips 
               his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear 
               or whatever.

               A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.

<strong>                                     CREATURE
</strong>                         Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?

               The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore 
               the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby 
               Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the 
               belligerent monstrosity.

<strong>                                     HUMAN

               The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some 
               unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young 
               adventurer.

                         the death sentence in twelve systems.

               The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar 
               moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His 
               three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind 
               Luke.

<strong>                                     BEN
</strong>                         This little one isn't worth the 
                         effort. Come let me buy you 
                         something...

               A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young 
               would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables 
               and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid. 
               With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked 
               chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben. 
               The bartender panics.

<strong>                                     BARTENDER
</strong>                         No blasters! No blaster!

               With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life 
               and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut 
               in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, 
               cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns 
               off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. 
               Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, 
               attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter 
               of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is 
               given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing 
               his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben 
               points the the Wookiee.

               Threepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on 
               an electronic conversation with another little red astro-
               droid. A creature comes out of the cantina and approaches 
               two stormtroopers in the street.

               Strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking 
               instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and 
               follows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is 
               sitting. Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years 
               old. A mercenary on a starship, he is simple, sentimental, 
               and cocksure.

               Ben reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with 
               obvious misinformation.

               Ben and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers 
               looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some 
               questions. The bartender points to the booth.

               are gone. The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement.

               As Han is about to leave, Greedo, a slimy green-faced alien 
               with a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side. The creature 
               speaks in a foreign tongue translated into English subtitles.

</strong>                         Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I 
                         was just going to see your boss. 
                         Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

               Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the 
               gun on him.

<strong>                                     GREEDO
</strong>                         It's too late. You should have paid 
                         him when you had the chance. Jabba's 
                         put a price on your head, so large 
                         that every bounty hunter in the galaxy 
                         will be looking for you. I'm lucky I 
                         found you first.

                         I found you.

                         time for smugglers who drop their 
                         shipments at the first sign of an 
                         Imperial cruiser.

               Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.

</strong>                         You can tell that to Jabba. He may 
                         only take your ship.

               Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of 
               light. Han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as 
               the other patron look on in bemused amazement. Han gets up 
               and starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some 
               coins as he leaves.

               Threepio peeks out. Artoo is barely visible in the background.

                         Since the XP-38 came out, they're 
                         just not in demand.

               Ben and Luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty 
               alleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater-like 
               creatures. Luke turns and gives one last forlorn look at his 
               faithful speeder as he rounds a corner. A darkly clad creature 
               moves out of the shadows as they pass and watches them as 
               they disappear down another alley.

</strong>
               Jabba the Hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and purple 
               creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay. Jabba is 
               the grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is 
               a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer. He is 
               a fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and 
               a huge ugly mouth.

</strong>                         Come on out, Solo!

               A voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and 
               they turn around to see Han Solo and the giant Wookiee, 
               Chewbacca, standing behind them with no weapons in sight.

                         Han, my boy, there are times when 
                         you disappoint me... why haven't you 
                         paid me? And why did you have to fry 
                         poor Greedo like that... after all 
                         we've been through together.

                         Han, why you're the best smuggler in 
                         the business. You're too valuable to 
                         fry. He was only relaying my concern 
                         at your delays. He wasn't going to 
                         blast you.

                         don't send one of those twerps. If 
                         you've got something to say to me, 
                         come see me yourself.

                         dump that shipment of spice... you 
                         understand I just can't make an 
                         exception. Where would I be if every 
                         pilot who smuggled for me dumped 
                         their shipment at the first sign of 
                         an Imperial starship? It's not good 
                         business.

</strong>                         You know, even I get boarded 
                         sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice, 
                         but I've got a charter now and I can 
                         pay you back, plus a little extra. I 
                         just need some more time.

                         I'm only doing this because you're 
                         the best and I need you. So, for an 
                         extra, say twenty percent I'll give 
                         you a little more time... but this 
                         is it. If you disappoint me again, 
                         I'll put a price on your head so 
                         large you won't be able to go near a 
                         civilized system for the rest of 
                         your short life.

<strong>               EXT. DOCKING PORT ENTRY - ALLEYWAY
</strong>
               Chewbacca waits restlessly at the entrance to Docking Bay 
               94.  Ben, Luke, and the robots make their way up the street.  
               Chewbacca jabbers excitedly and signals for them to hurry. 
               The darkly clad creature has followed them from the speeder 
               lot.  He stops in a nearby doorway and speaks into a small 
               transmitter.

<strong>               INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94
</strong>
               Chewbacca leads the group into a giant dirt pit that is 
               Docking Bay 94. Resting in the middle of the huge hole is a 
               large, round, beat-up, pieced-together hunk of junk that 
               could only loosely be called a starship.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         What a piece of junk.

               The tall figure of Han Solo comes down the boarding ramp.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         She'll make point five beyond the 
                         speed of light. She may not look 
                         like much, but she's got it where it 
                         counts, kid. I've added some special 
                         modifications myself.

               Luke scratches his head. It's obvious he isn't sure about 
               all this. Chewbacca rushes up the ramp and urges the others 
               to follow.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         We're a little rushed, so if you'll 
                         hurry aboard we'll get out of here.

               The group rushes up the gang plank, passing a grinning Han 
               Solo.

<strong>               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

               Chewbacca settles into the pilot's chair and starts the mighty

               Eight Imperial stormtroopers rush up to the darkly clad 
               creature.

               The darkly clad creature points to the door of the docking 
               bay.

<strong>                                     TROOPER

               The troops hold their guns at the ready and charge down the 
               docking bay entrance.

</strong>                         Stop that ship!

               Han Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers rushing 
               into the docking bay. Several of the troopers fire at Han as 
               he ducks into the spaceship.

</strong>                         Blast 'em!

               Han draws his laser pistol and pops off a couple of shots 
               which force the stormtroopers to dive for safety. The 
               pirateship engines whine as Han hits the release button that 
               slams the overhead entry shut.

               The group straps in for take off.

                         hate space travel.

<strong>               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREETS

               The half-dozen stormtroopers at a check point hear the general 
               alarm and look to the sky as the huge starship rises above 
               the dingy slum dwellings and quickly disappears into the 
               morning sky.

<strong>               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Han climbs into the pilot's chair next to Chewbacca, who 
               chatters away as he points to something on the radar scope.

               The Corellian pirateship zooms from Tatooine into space.

               Han frantically types information into the ship's computer.  
               Little Artoo appears momentarily at the cockpit doorway, 
               makes a few beeping remarks, then scurries away.

                         thought. Try and hold them off. Angle 
                         the deflector shield while I make 
                         the calculations for the jump to

               The Millennium Falcon pirateship races away from the yellow 
               planet, Tatooine. It is followed by two huge Imperial

               Over the shoulders of Chewbacca and Han, we can see the galaxy 
               spread before them. Luke and Ben make their way into the 
               cramped cockpit where Han continues his calculation.

               The ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it.

                         your trip real quick, wouldn't it?

               The ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red 
               warning light begins to flash.

                         make the jump to light speed.

               The galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if 
               crashing a barrier. Stars become streaks as the pirateship

                         how hard I found it signing the order

</strong>                         Princess Leia, before your execution 
                         I would like you to be my guest at a 
                         ceremony that will make this battle 
                         station operational. No star system 
                         will dare oppose the Emperor now.

</strong>                         The more you tighten your grip, 
                         Tarkin, the more star systems will 
                         slip through your fingers.

<strong>                                     TARKIN
</strong>                         Not after we demonstrate the power 
                         of this station. In a way, you have 
                         determined the choice of the planet 
                         that'll be destroyed first. Since 
                         you are reluctant to provide us with 
                         the location of the Rebel base, I 
                         have chosen to test this station's 
                         destructive power... on your home 
                         planet of Alderaan.

<strong>                                     LEIA
</strong>                         No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no 
                         weapons. You can't possibly...

</strong>                         You would prefer another target? A 
                         military target? Then name the system!

               Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.

<strong>                                     TARKIN
</strong>                         I grow tired of asking this. So it'll 
                         be the last time. Where is the Rebel 
                         base?

               Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to 
               Alderaan.

               Leia lowers her head.

</strong>                         They're on Dantooine.

</strong>                         There. You see Lord Vader, she can 
                         be reasonable.
                              (addressing Motti)
                         Continue with the operation. You may 
                         fire when ready.

</strong>                         You're far too trusting. Dantooine 
                         is too remote to make an effective 
                         demonstration. But don't worry. We 
                         will deal with your Rebel friends 
                         soon enough.

               A button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. A 
               hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever.  
               Another lever is pulled. Vader reaches for still another 
               lever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. A 
               huge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area 
               and converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan. 
               The small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust.

               Ben watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small "seeker" 
               robot. Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. He falters, 
               seems almost faint.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Are you all right? What's wrong?

</strong>                         I felt a great disturbance in the 
                         Force... as if millions of voices 
                         suddenly cried out in terror and 
                         were suddenly silenced. I fear 
                         something terrible has happened.

               Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then 
               he fixes his gaze on Luke.

<strong>                                     BEN
</strong>                         You'd better get on with your 
                         exercises.

               Han Solo enters the room.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         Well, you can forget your troubles 
                         with those Imperial slugs. I told 
                         you I'd outrun 'em.

               Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         Don't everyone thank me at once.

               Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a 
               game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move 
               along a chess-type board.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         Anyway, we should be at Alderaan 
                         about oh-two-hundred hours.

               Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table 
               covered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the 
               table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca 
               seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur- 
               covered arms over his head.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Now be careful, Artoo.

               Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his 
               stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures 
               to walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's 
               face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot. 
               Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and 
               begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         He made a fair move. Screaming about 
                         it won't help you.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                              (interrupting)
                         Let him have it. It's not wise to 
                         upset a Wookiee.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         But sir, nobody worries about 
                         upsetting a droid.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         That's 'cause droids don't pull 
                         people's arms out of their socket 
                         when they lose. Wookiees are known 
                         to do that.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         I see your point, sir. I suggest a 
                         new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee 
                         win.

               Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems 
               frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his 
               head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements.  
               Han watches with a bit of smugness.

</strong>                         Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force 
                         flowing through him.

</strong>                         Partially. But it also obeys your 
                         commands.

               Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a 
               "seeker", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae, 
               hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of 
               the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift 
               lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke doesn't 
               move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy, 
               then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood 
               red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing 
               him to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.

</strong>                         Hokey religions and ancient weapons 
                         are no match for a good blaster at 
                         your side, kid.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         You don't believe in the Force, do 
                         you?

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         Kid, I've flown from one side of 
                         this galaxy to the other. I've seen 
                         a lot of strange stuff, but I've 
                         never seen anything to make me believe 
                         there's one all-powerful force 
                         controlling everything. There's no 
                         mystical energy field that controls 
                         my destiny.

               Ben smiles quietly.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         It's all a lot of simple tricks and 
                         nonsense.

</strong>                         I suggest you try it again, Luke.

               Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his 
               eyes.

<strong>                                     BEN
</strong>                         This time, let go your conscious 
                         self and act on instinct.

<strong>                                     LUKE

                         With the blast shield down, I can't 
                         even see. How am I supposed to fight?

<strong>                                     BEN
</strong>                         Your eyes can deceive you. Don't 
                         trust them.

               Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker 
               into the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then 
               drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly 
               missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits 
               Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful 
               yell and attempts to hit the seeker.

</strong>                         Stretch out with your feelings.

               Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes 
               a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the 
               bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original 
               position.

                         thing as luck.

</strong>                         Look, going good against remotes is 
                         one thing. Going good against the 
                         living? That's something else.

               Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the 
               control panel.

<strong>                                     HAN

                         Alderaan.

               Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit.

                         could almost see the remote.

               The pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange 
               surreal light show surrounds the ship.

                         the sublight engines.

               Han pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit window 
               stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then 
               stop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently 
               shake about. Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering 
               the sides of the ship.

                         hyperspace into a meteor shower. 
                         Some kind of asteroid collision. 
                         It's not on any of the charts.

               The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool 
               in the emergency. Luke makes his way into the bouncing 
               cockpit.

               settle down.

               alarm starts humming.

               Chewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outside 
               the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A tiny, finned 
               Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window.

                         immediately. All right, let's go.

               The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound 
               is followed by a voice calling to the guard below.

<strong>                                     HAN'S VOICE
</strong>                         Hey down there, could you give us a 
                         hand with this?

               The stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire 
               is heard.

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - FORWARD BAY - COMMAND OFFICE
</strong>
               In a very small command office near the entrance to the 
               pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices 
               the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.

<strong>                                     GANTRY OFFICER
</strong>                         TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at 
                         your post? TX-four-one-two, do you 
                         copy?

               A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and 
               waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating 
               his comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his 
               head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an 
               annoyed look.

<strong>                                     GANTRY OFFICER
</strong>                         Take over. We've got a bad 
                         transmitter. I'll see what I can do.

               As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing 
               the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary 
               state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling 
               howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. 
               The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted 
               by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and the 
               robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed 
               as a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         You know, between his howling and 
                         your blasting everything in sight, 
                         it's a wonder the whole station 
                         doesn't know we're here.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         Bring them on! I prefer a straight 
                         fight to all this sneaking around.

</strong>                         We found the computer outlet, sir.

               Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of 
               the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it 
               carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.  
               Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.

<strong>                                     BEN
</strong>                         Plug in. He should be able to 
                         interpret the entire Imperial computer 
                         network.

               Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the 
               vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information 
               to the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         He says he's found the main computer 
                         to power the tractor beam that's 
                         holding the ship here. He'll try to 
                         make the precise location appear on 
                         the monitor.

               The computer monitor flashes readouts.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         The tractor beam is coupled to the 
                         main reactor in seven locations. A 
                         power loss at one of the terminals 
                         will allow the ship to leave.

               Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.

</strong>                         I don't think you boys can help. I

</strong>                         Whatever you say. I've done more 
                         that I bargained for on this trip 
                         already.

</strong>                         But he can...

</strong>                         They must be delivered safely or

                         same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny 
                         lies along a different path than 
                         mine. The Force will be with you... 
                         always!

               Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps 
               out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey 
               hallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head 
               in agreement.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         Boy you said it, Chewie.

               Han looks at Luke.

</strong>                         Where did you dig up that old fossil?

</strong>                         Well, anything would be better than 
                         just hanging around waiting for him 
                         to pick us up...

</strong>                         Who do you think...

               Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak.  
               Luke goes over to him.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         What is it?

                         He says "I found her", and keeps 
                         repeating, "She's here."

</strong>                         Well, who... who has he found?

               Artoo whistles a frantic reply.

                         into the detention block?

               Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt.

                         there will you?

               Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.

</strong>                         Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on 
                         you.

               Chewie lets out a hideous growl.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Okay. Han, you put these on.

               Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know 
                         what he has in mind.

               The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as 
               Han binds him with the electronic cuffs.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO

                         Artoo and I do if we're discovered 
                         here?

</strong>                         And hope they don't have blasters.

</strong>                         That isn't very reassuring.

               Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and 
               start off into the giant Imperial Death Star.

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE
</strong>
               Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits 
               as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops, 
               bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio 
               completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious 
               glance.

               Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         I can't see a thing in this helmet.

               A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away 
               by Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and 
               the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY
</strong>
               Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main 
               passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot 
               similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end 
               of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then 
               disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting 
               that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. 
               No one in the hallway seems to notice him.

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY 
</strong><strong>               AREA
</strong>
               Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door 
               slides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards 
               enter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates 
               are everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         This is not going to work.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Why didn't you say so before?

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         I did say so before!

<strong>               INT. DETENTION AREA
</strong>
               Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches 
               the trio.

<strong>                                     OFFICER
</strong>                         Where are you taking this... thing?

               Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut 
               up.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-
                         three-eight.

<strong>                                     OFFICER
</strong>                         I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear 
                         it.

               The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in 
               the information. There are only three other troopers in the 
               area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the 
               alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of 
               Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.

               Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one 
               of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         Look out! He's loose!

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         He's going to pull us all apart.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         Go get him!

               The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and 
               Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are 
               blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of 
               laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser 
               gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the 
               last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is 
               about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink 
               system, which is screeching questions about what is going 
               on.  He quickly checks the computer readout.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         We've got to find out which cell

                         it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven. 
                         You go get her. I'll hold them here.

               Luke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into 
               the buzzing comlink.

                              hall)
                         Luke! We're going to have company!

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - CELL ROW
</strong>
               Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door 
               away with a laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees 
               the dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping 
               and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on 
               her face. Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands 
               staring at her with his mouth hanging open.

               Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.

               An ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the 
               elevator door.

               Chewbacca responds with a growling noise.

</strong>                         Get behind me! Get behind me!

               A series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door 
               through which several Imperial troops begin to emerge.

               Han and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke 
               and flame. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting 
               up with Luke and Leia rushing toward them.

               Luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they 
               continue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their 
               way down the corridor.

               Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as 
               they continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca 
               are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far 
               and of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke

               Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.

               The princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate in 
               the wall next to Han, almost frying him.

               She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca 
               look on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and 
               says something.

                         there and don't worry about it.

               Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the 
               tiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their 
               way toward the opening.

               Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han fires 
               off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then 
               slides into the chute himself and is gone.

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM
</strong>
               Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck.  
               Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He 
               finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won't 
               budge.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                              (sarcastically)
                         Oh! The garbage chute was a really 
                         wonderful idea. What an incredible 
                         smell you've discovered! Let's get 
                         out of here! Get away from there...

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         No! wait!

               Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The 
               laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.  
               Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes 
               almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a 
               rather grim look on her face.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Will you forget it? I already tried 
                         it. It's magnetically sealed!

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I 
                         had everything under control until 
                         you led us down here. You know, it's 
                         not going to take them long to figure 
                         out what happened to us.

</strong>                         It could be worse...

               A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the 
               murky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins 
               to back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols 
               drawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         It's worse.

</strong>                         There's something alive in here!

</strong>                         That's your imagination.

</strong>                         Something just moves past my leg! 
                         Look! Did you see that?

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         What?

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Help!

               Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         Luke! Luke! Luke!

               Solo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air 
               and thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around 
               his throat.

<strong>                                     LEIA
</strong>                         Luke!

               Leia extends a long pipe toward him.

<strong>                                     LEIA
</strong>                         Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.

</strong>                         Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         Where?

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Anywhere! Oh!!

               Solo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the 
               muck by the slimy tentacle.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         Luke! Luke!

               Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and 
               move in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet.  
               Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca 
               howls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke 
               suddenly bobs to the surface.

<strong>                                     LEIA
</strong>                         Grab him!

               Luke seems to be released by the thing.

<strong>                                     LEIA
</strong>                         What happened?

</strong>                         I don't know, it just let go of me 
                         and disappeared...

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         I've got a very bad feeling about 
                         this.

               Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and 
               edge toward the Rebels.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         The walls are moving!

</strong>                         Don't just stand there. Try to brace 
                         it with something.

               They place poles and long metal beams between the closing 
               walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant 
               trashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look too good.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Wait a minute!

               Luke pulls out his comlink.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! 
                         Where could he be?

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN GANTRY - COMMAND OFFICE
</strong>
               A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for 
               See-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which 
               is sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and 
               Threepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great 
               explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the 
               floor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.

<strong>                                     FIRST TROOPER
</strong>                         Take over!
                              (pointing to the dead 
                              officer)
                         See to him! Look there!

               A trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides 
               open. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo follows 
               his bronze companion out into the office.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         They're madmen! They're heading for 
                         the prison level. If you hurry, you 
                         might catch them.

<strong>                                     FIRST OFFICER

                         Follow me! You stand guard.

               The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to 
               watch over the command office.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                              (to Artoo)
                         Come on!

               The guard aims a blaster at them.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Oh! All this excitement has overrun 
                         the circuits of my counterpart here. 
                         If you don't mind, I'd like to take 
                         him down to maintenance.

<strong>                                     TROOPER
</strong>                         All right.

               The guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries 
               out the door.

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM
</strong>
               As the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller.  
               Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his 
               giant paws.

               Han is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is 
               snapping and popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!

               Han and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole. 
               Leia begins to sink into the trash.

<strong>                                     HAN

                         been captured.

               Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall 
               socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from 
               the tiny robot.

               The walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced against 
               the walls. The princess is frightened. They look at each 
               other. Leia reaches out and takes Han's hand and she holds 
               it tightly. She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels 
               the first crushing pressure against her body.

                         them! Where could they be?

               Artoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.

               Meanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his 
               head above the rising ooze. Luke's comlink begins to buzz 
               and he rips it off his belt.

               Muffled sounds of Luke's voice over the comlink can be heard,

               The screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief.

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - TRACTOR BEAM - POWER GENERATOR TRENCH
</strong>
               Ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge 
               tractor beam. The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep. 
               The clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard. 
               The old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading 
               to a control panel that connects two large cables. He 
               carefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal, 
               and several lights on the board go from red to blue.

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - UNUSED HALLWAY
</strong>
               The group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway.  
               Han and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster 
               belts.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         If we can just avoid any more female 
                         advice, we ought to be able to get 
                         out of here.

               Luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster 
               from Solo.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Well, let's get moving!

               Chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage 
               room, as he runs away and then stops howling.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                              (to Chewie)
                         Where are you going?

               The Dia Nogu bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy 
               tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a 
               victim. Han aims his pistol.

<strong>                                     LEIA
</strong>                         No, wait. They'll hear!

               Han fires at the doorway. The noise of the blast echoes 
               relentlessly throughout the empty passageway. Luke simply 
               shakes his head in disgust.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                              (to Chewie)
                         Come here, you big coward!

               Chewie shakes his head "no."

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         Chewie! Come here!

                         on, you do as I tell you. Okay?

               Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get 
                         one thing straight! I take orders 
                         from one person! Me!

                              (looking at Chewie)
                         Will somebody get this big walking 
                         carpet out of my way?

               Han watches her start away. He looks at Luke.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         No reward is worth this.

               They follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor.

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - POWER TRENCH
</strong>
               Suddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of 
               stormtroopers marches to the power trench. Ben instantly 
               slips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few 
               feet of him.

<strong>                                     OFFICER

                         canceled.

               All but two of the stormtroopers leave.

</strong>                         Do you know what's going on?

<strong>                                     SECOND TROOPER
</strong>                         Maybe it's another drill.

               Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers 
               as they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures with his hand 
               toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the 
               other hallway. With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips 
               past the troopers and into the main hallway.

<strong>                                     SECOND TROOPER
</strong>                         What was that?

<strong>                                     FIRST TROOPER
</strong>                         Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about 
                         it.

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY
</strong>
               Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and 
               stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers 
               are milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                              (looking at his ship)
                         There she is.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         See-Threepio, do you copy?

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                              (voice)
                         For the moment. Uh, we're in the 
                         main hangar across from the ship.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         We're right above you. Stand by.

               Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of 
               the pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and 
               points out the window to the ship.

<strong>                                     LEIA
</strong>                         You came in that thing? You're braver 
                         that I thought.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         Nice! Come on!

               Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the 
               hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty 
               Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are 
               taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.

<strong>                                     FIRST TROOPER
</strong>                         It's them! Blast them!

               Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges 
               the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the 
               stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down 
               the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                              (to Luke and Leia)
                         Get back to the ship!

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Where are you going? Come back!

               Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.

<strong>                                     LEIA
</strong>                         He certainly has courage.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         What good will it do us if he gets 
                         himself killed? Come on!

               Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for 
               muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke 
               and Leia start off toward the starship hangar.

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY
</strong>
               Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is 
               yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a 
               dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few 
               feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops 
               begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are 
               moving into an attack position in front of the lone 
               starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops 
               begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY
</strong>
               Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt 
               to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of 
               laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate 
               extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of 
               furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running 
               the other way also.

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY
</strong>
               Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down 
               a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They 
               quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an 
               open hatchway.

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT
</strong>
               Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge 
               that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. 
               The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, 
               and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance 
               off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of 
               his arm and pulls him back.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                              (gasping)
                         I think we took a wrong turn.

               Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby 
               reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at 
               the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch 
               that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving 
               them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.  
               Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.

<strong>                                     LEIA
</strong>                         There's no lock!

               Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         That oughta hold it for a while.

<strong>                                     LEIA
</strong>                         Quick, we've got to get across. Find 
                         the control that extends the bridge.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Oh, I think I just blasted it.

               Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the 
               stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making 
               ominous drilling and pounding sounds.

<strong>                                     LEIA
</strong>                         They're coming through!

               Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when 
               laserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol 
               at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across 
               the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops 
               appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, 
               and grabs at his chest.

               Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by 
               Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move 
               back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Here, hold this.

               Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. 
               It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge 
               overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the 
               rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears 
               and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.  
               Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet 
               of more troops.

<strong>                                     LEIA
</strong>                         Here they come!

               Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and 
               he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the 
               gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He 
               tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the 
               princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him 
               quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.

<strong>                                     LEIA
</strong>                         For luck!

               Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss 
               to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as 
               Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the 
               stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at 
               the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into 
               the tiny subhallway.

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - NARROW PASSAGEWAY
</strong>
               Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several 
               stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks 
               to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the 
               opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of 
               the hallway and starts after the old Jedi.

               Threepio looks around at the troops milling about the

               Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left 
               and right, beeping a response.

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR - BLAST SHIELDS DOOR

               Han and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several 
               troopers hot on their trail.

               At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in 
               front of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion 
               race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage 
               to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops 
               before the doors slam shut.

               Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar 
               where the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar, 
               Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not 
               ten feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also ignites his 
               and steps slowly forward.

</strong>                         I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. 
                         We meet again, at last. The circle 
                         is now complete.

               Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive 
               position. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance.

<strong>                                     VADER
</strong>                         When I left you, I was but the 
                         learner; now I am the master.

<strong>                                     BEN
</strong>                         Only a master of evil, Darth.

               The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few 
               moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right 
               moment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain, 
               as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He 
               shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes.

               Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked 
               by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke 
               by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's 
               blows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark 
               Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar. 
               The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments 
               with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing 
               sound.

<strong>                                     VADER
</strong>                         Your powers are weak, old man.

<strong>                                     BEN
</strong>                         You can't win, Darth. If you strike 
                         me down, I shall become more powerful 
                         than you can possibly imagine.

               Their lightsabers continue to meet in combat.

               Han Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back 
               against the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the 
               Imperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar.

               Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they 
               hit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact. 
               Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord 
               of The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his 
               group's vantage point.

</strong>                         Look!

               Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader 
               emerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking 
               bay.

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY

               Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star's 
               Imperial docking bay.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Come on, Artoo, we're going!

               Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who 
               were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards 
               Ben and The Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo.

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY
</strong>
               Solo, Chewie, Luke, and Leia tensely watch the duel. The 
               troops rush toward the battling knights.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         Now's our chance! Go!

               They start for the Millennium Falcon. Ben sees the troops 
               charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader 
               takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings 
               his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to 
               deflect the blow and swiftly turns around.

               The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts 
               his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene 
               look on his face.

               Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's 
               cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it.  
               Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the 
               empty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers 
               and the robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two 
               and starts for him. Aghast, he yells out.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         No!

               The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him.  
               The robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium 
               Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns 
               their fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader looks up and 
               advances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down.

<strong>                                     HAN

</strong>                         Blast the door! Kid!

               Luke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it 
               explodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge 
               forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close 
               behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the 
               docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his 
               onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops, 
               as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He 
               fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor.

<strong>                                     BEN'S VOICE
</strong>                         Run, Luke! Run!

               Luke looks around to see where the voice came from. He turns 
               toward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the 
               troopers and races into the ship.

                         going to be a real short trip. Okay, 
                         hit it!

               Chewbacca growls in agreement.

               The Millennium Falcon powers away from the Death Star docking 
               bay, makes a spectacular turn and disappears into the vastness

               Luke, saddened by the loss of Obi-Wan Kenobi, stares off 
               blankly as the robots look on. Leia puts a blanket around 
               him protectively, and Luke turns and looks up at her. She 
               sits down beside him.

               Two TIE fighters move toward and over the Millennium Falcon, 
               unleashing a barrage of laserbolts at the ship.

<strong>               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS
</strong>
               Another TIE fighter moves in on the pirateship and Luke, 
               smiling, fires the laser cannon at it, scoring a spectacular 
               direct hit.

</strong>                         Got him! I got him!

               Han turns and gives Luke a victory wave which Luke gleefully 
               returns.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         Great kid! Don't get cocky.

               Han turns back to his laser cannon.

               Two more TIE fighters cross in front of the pirateship.

               While Chewbacca manipulates the controls, Leia turns, looking 
               over her shoulder out the ports.

               A TIE fighter moves up over the pirateship, firing laserblasts 
               at it.

<strong>               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS
</strong>
               Luke and Han look into their respective projected target 
               screens. An Imperial fighter crosses Solo's port, and Han 
               swivels in his chair, following it with blasts from his laser 
               cannon. Another fighter crosses Luke's port, and he reacts 
               in a like manner, the glow of his target screen lighting his 
               face.

<strong>               EXT. SPACE
</strong>
               The TIE fighter zooms toward the pirateship, firing 
               destructive blasts at it.

<strong>               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS
</strong>
               Luke fires a laserblast at the approaching enemy fighter, 
               and it bursts into a spectacular explosion. Luke's projected 
               screen gives a readout of the hit. The pirateship bounces 
               slightly as it is struck by the enemy fire.

<strong>               EXT. SPACE - TIE FIGHTER
</strong>
               The last of the attacking Imperial TIE fighters looms in, 
               firing upon the Falcon.

<strong>               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORT
</strong>
               Solo swivels behind his cannon, his aim describing the arc 
               of the TIE fighter. The fighter comes closer, firing at the 
               pirateship, but a well-aimed blast from Solo's laser cannon 
               hits the attacker, which blows up in a small atomic shower 
               of burning fragments.

               The princess jumps up and gives Chewie a congratulatory hug.

               Threepio lies on the floor of the ship, completely tangled 
               in the smoking, sparking wires.

                         an awful risk, Vader. This had better

               Han, removes his gloves and smiling, is at the controls of 
               the ship. Chewie moves into the aft section to check the 
               damage. Leia is seated near Han.

               She angrily turns, and as she starts out of the cockpit, 
               passes Luke coming in.

               Luke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat. He and Han 
               stare out at the vast blackness of space.

</strong>                         No!

               Luke says it with finality and looks away. Han smiles at 
               young Luke's jealousy.

               The battered pirateship drifts into orbit around the planet 
               Yavin and proceeds to one of its tiny green moons.

               The pirateship soars over the dense jungle.

<strong>               EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST
</strong>
               An alert guard, his laser gun in hand, scans the countryside.  
               He sets the gun down and looks toward the temple, barely 
               visible in the foliage.

<strong>               EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE TEMPLE
</strong>
               Rotting in a forest of gargantuan trees, an ancient temple 
               lies shrouded in an eerie mist. The air is heavy with the 
               fantastic cries of unimaginable creatures. Han, Luke and the 
               others are greeted by the Rebel troops.

               Luke and the group ride into the massive temple on an armored 
               military speeder.

<strong>               INT. MASSASSI - MAIN HANGAR DECK
</strong>
               The military speeder stops in a huge spaceship hangar, set 
               up in the interior of the crumbling temple. Willard, the 
               commander of the Rebel forces, rushes up to the group and 
               gives Leia a big hug. Every one is pleased to see her.

                         You're safe! We had feared the worst.

               Willard composes himself, steps back and bows formally.

               A lone guard stands in a tower high above the Yavin landscape,

<strong>               INT. MASSASSI - WAR ROOM BRIEFING AREA

               Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. Leia 
               and several other senators are to one side of the giant 
               readout. The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots, 
               navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is 
               listening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and 
               Chewbacca are standing near the back.

<strong>                                     DODONNA
</strong>                         The battle station is heavily shielded 
                         and carries a firepower greater than 
                         half the star fleet. It's defenses 
                         are designed around a direct large-
                         scale assault. A small one-man fighter 
                         should be able to penetrate the outer 
                         defense.

               Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands 
               and addresses Dodonna.

</strong>                         Pardon me for asking, sir, but what 
                         good are snub fighters going to be 
                         against that?

<strong>                                     DODONNA
</strong>                         Well, the Empire doesn't consider a 
                         small one-man fighter to be any 
                         threat, or they'd have a tighter 
                         defense. An analysis of the plans 
                         provided by Princess Leia has 
                         demonstrated a weakness in the battle 
                         station.

               Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping 
               sounds, and turns his head from right to left.

</strong>                         The approach will not be easy. You 
                         are required to maneuver straight 
                         down this trench and skim the surface 
                         to this point. The target area is 
                         only two meters wide. It's a small 
                         thermal exhaust port, right below 
                         the main port. The shaft leads 
                         directly to the reactor system. A 
                         precise hit will start a chain 
                         reaction which should destroy the 
                         station.

               A murmer of disbelief runs through the room.

</strong>                         Only a precise hit will set up a 
                         chain reaction. The shaft is ray-
                         shielded, so you'll have to use proton 
                         torpedoes.

               Luke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship 
               hangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters.  
               Flight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and 
               unlocking power couplings. In an area isolated from this 
               activity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca loading small boxes 
               onto an armored speeder.

                         All flight troops, man your stations.

               Han is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter 
               pilots' preparation. Luke is quite saddened at the sight of 
               his friend's departure.

                         courage. It's more like suicide.

                         you're best at, isn't it?

               Luke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him.

               Luke turns and sees Han wink at him. Luke lifts his hand in 
               a small wave and then goes off.

               Han turns to Chewie who growls at his captain,

<strong>               INT. MAIN HANGAR DECK - LUKE'S SHIP

               Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.

                         thought he'd change his mind.

</strong>                         He's got to follow his own path. No

</strong>                         I only wish Ben were here.

               Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. As Luke 
               heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs 
               his arm.

                         us?!

                         stories to tell...

               Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up 
               behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born 
               leader.

<strong>                                     RED LEADER
</strong>                         Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you 
                         been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-

                         the outer rim territories.

               Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of 
               his fighter.

               Red Leader hurries to his own ship.

</strong>                              (going off)
                         You did, all right. It's going to be 
                         like old times, Luke. We're a couple 
                         of shooting stars that'll never be 
                         stopped!

               Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for 
               his ship.

               As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly 
               spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points 
               to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the 
               back of the fighter.

<strong>                                     CHIEF
</strong>                         This R2 unit of your seems a bit 
                         beat up. Do you want a new one?

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Not on your life! That little droid 
                         and I have been through a lot 
                         together.
                              (to Artoo)
                         You okay, Artoo?

               The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of 
               the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps 
               that he is fine.

               Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an 
               his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive 
               hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner 
               into Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo 
               beeps good-bye.

<strong>                                     CHIEF
</strong>                         Okay, easy she goes!

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to 
                         come back.

               Artoo beeps in agreement.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         You wouldn't want my life to get 
                         boring, would you?

               Artoo whistles his reply.

               All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.  
               The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the 
               pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The 
               hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted 
               voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses 
               are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit 
               shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman, 
               holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace 
               of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.

</strong>                         Luke, the Force will be with you.

               Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.

               All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing 
               on a small pedestal jutting out above the dense jungle. The 
               muted gruesome crying sounds that naturally permeate this 
               eerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the thundering din of ion 
               rockets as four silver starships catapult from the foliage

               ever closer to the system. A series of green dots appear 
               around the fourth moon. A din of indistinct chatter fills

               Light from a distant sun creates an eerie atmospheric glow

               Luke adjusts his controls as he concentrates on the 
               approaching Death Star. The ship begins to be buffeted 
               slightly.

               The fighters, now X-shaped darts, move in formation. The 
               Death Star now appears to be a small moon growing rapidly in 
               size as the Rebel fighters approach. Complex patterns on the 
               metallic surface begin to become visible. A large dish antenna 
               is built into the surface on one side.

               As the fighters move closer to the Death Star, the awesome 
               size of the gargantuan Imperial fortress is revealed. Half 
               of the deadly space station is in shadow and this area 
               sparkles with thousands of small lights running in thin lines 
               and occasionally grouped in large clusters; somewhat like a 
               city at night as seen from a weather satellite.

               Red Leader looks around at his wingmen; the Death Star looming 
               in from behind. Two Y-wing fighters bob back and forth in 
               the background. He moves his computer targeting device into 
               position.

               Two squads of Rebel fighters peel off. The X-wings dive

               Alarm sirens scream as soldiers scramble to large turbo- 
               powered laser gun emplacements. Electronic drivers rotate 
               the huge guns into position as crew adjust their targeting 
               devices.

<strong>               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR
</strong>
               Laserbolts streak through the star-filled night. The Rebel X-
               wing fighters move in toward the Imperial base, as the Death 
               Star aims its massive laser guns at the Rebel forces and 
               fires.

               Luke nosedives radically, starting his attack on the monstrous

               Luke's X-wing races toward the Death Star. Laserbolts streak 
               from Luke's weapons, creating a huge fireball explosion on 
               the dim surface.

               Terror crosses Luke's face as he realizes he won't be able

               Walls buckle and cave in. Troops and equipment are blown in

               Standing in the middle of the chaos, a vision of calm and

               Smoke belches from the giant laser guns as they wind up their 
               turbine generators to create sufficient power. The crew rushes 
               about preparing for another blast. Even the troopers head 
               gear is not adequate to protect them from the overwhelming 
               noise of the monstrous weapon. One troopers bangs his helmet 
               with his hand in an attempt to stop the ringing.

               Luke flings his X-wing into a twisting dive across the horizon

               A shot hurls from Luke's guns. Laserbolts streak toward the 
               onrushing Death Star surface. Several small radar emplacements 
               erupt in flame. Laserfire erupts from a protruding tower on

               The blurry Death Star surface races past the cockpit window

               The thunder and smoke of the big guns reverberate throughout

               Biggs dives through a forest of radar domes, antennae, and

               Gold Leader races down the enormous trench that leads to the

               As the fighters begin to approach the target area, suddenly

               as the surface whips past in a blur.

               One of the engines explodes on Gold Five's Y-wing fighter, 
               blazing out of control. He dives past the horizon toward the 
               Death Star's surface, passing a TIE fighter during his

<strong>               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT
</strong>
               Luke looks about, wondering whose laserfire destroyed Vader's 
               wingman.

<strong>               INT. DARTH VADER'S COCKPIT
</strong>
               Vader is taken by surprise, and looks out from his cockpit.

<strong>                                     VADER
</strong>                         What?

<strong>               INT. DARTH VADER'S WINGMAN - COCKPIT
</strong>
               Vader's wingman searches around him trying to locate the 
               unknown attacker.

<strong>               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</strong>
               Han and Chewbacca grin from ear to ear.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                              (yelling)
                         Yahoo!

<strong>               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR
</strong>
               The Millennium Falcon heads right at the two TIE fighters.  
               It's a collision course.

<strong>               INT. WINGMAN'S COCKPIT
</strong>
               The wingman spots the pirateship coming at him and warns the 
               Dark Lord.

<strong>                                     WINGMAN
</strong>                         Look out!

<strong>               EXT. DEATH STAR TRENCH
</strong>
               Vader's wingman panics at the sight of the oncoming pirate 
               starship and veers radically to one side, colliding with 
               Vader's TIE fighter in the process. Vader's wingman crashes 
               into the side wall of the trench and explodes. Vader's damaged 
               ship spins out of the trench with a damaged wing.

<strong>               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR
</strong>
               Vader's ship spins out of control with a bent solar fin, 
               heading for deep space.

<strong>               INT. DARTH VADER'S COCKPIT
</strong>
               Vader turns round and round in circles as his ship spins 
               into space.

<strong>               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR
</strong>
               Solo's ship moves in toward the Death Star trench.

<strong>               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</strong>
               Solo, smiling, speaks to Luke over his headset mike.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                              (into mike)
                         You're all clear, kid.

<strong>               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM
</strong>
               Leia and the others listen to Solo's transmission.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                              (over speaker)
                         Now let's blow this thing and go 
                         home!

<strong>               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT
</strong>
               Luke looks up and smiles. He concentrates on the exhaust 
               port, then fires his laser torpedoes.

<strong>               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR
</strong>
               Luke's torpedoes shoot toward the port and seems to simply 
               disappear into the surface and not explode. But the shots do 
               find their mark and have gone into the exhaust port and are 
               heading for the main reactor.

<strong>               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT
</strong>
               Luke throws his head back in relief.

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR
</strong>
               An Imperial soldier runs to the control panel board and pulls 
               the attack lever as the board behind him lights up.

<strong>                                     INTERCOM VOICE
</strong>                         Stand by to fire at Rebel base.

<strong>               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR
</strong>
               Two X-wings, a Y-wing, and the pirateship race toward Yavin 
               in the distance.

<strong>               INT. DEATH STAR
</strong>
               Several Imperial soldiers, flanking a pensive Grand Moff 
               Tarkin, busily push control levers and buttons.

<strong>                                     INTERCOM VOICE
</strong>                         Standing by.

               The rumble of a distant explosion begins.

<strong>               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR
</strong>
               The Rebel ships race out of sight, leaving the moon-like 
               Death Star alone against a blanket of stars. Several small 
               flashes appear on the surface. The Death Star bursts into a 
               supernova, creating a spectacular heavenly display.

<strong>               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</strong>
<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         Great shot, kid. That was one in a 
                         million.

<strong>               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT
</strong>
               Luke is at ease, and his eyes are closed.

<strong>                                     BEN'S VOICE
</strong>                         Remember, the Force will be with 
                         you... always.

               The ship rocks back and forth.

<strong>               EXT. DARTH VADER'S TIE FIGHTER
</strong>
               Vader's ship spins off into space.

<strong>               EXT. SPACE
</strong>
               The Rebel ships race toward the fourth moon of Yavin.

<strong>               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR
</strong>
               Luke climbs out of his starship fighter and is cheered by a 
               throng of ground crew and pilots. Luke climbs down the ladder 
               as they all welcome him with laughter, cheers, and shouting. 
               Princess Leia rushes toward him.

<strong>                                     LEIA
</strong>                         Luke! Luke! Luke!

               She throws her arms around Luke and hugs him as they dance 
               around in a circle. Solo runs in toward Luke and they embrace 
               one another, slapping each other on the back.

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                              (laughing)
                         Hey! Hey!

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                              (laughing)
                         I knew you'd come back! I just knew 
                         it!

<strong>                                     HAN
</strong>                         Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all 
                         the credit and take all the reward.

               Luke and Han look at one another, as Solo playfully shoves 
               at Luke's face. Leia moves in between them.

<strong>                                     LEIA
</strong>                              (laughing)
                         Hey, I knew there was more to you 
                         than money.

               Luke looks toward the ship.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         Oh, no!

               The fried little Artoo-Detoo is lifted off the back of the 
               fighter and carried off under the worried eyes of Threepio.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say 
                         something!
                              (to mechanic)
                         You can repair him, can't you?

<strong>                                     TECHNICIAN
</strong>                         We'll get to work on him right away.

<strong>                                     THREEPIO
</strong>                         You must repair him! Sir, if any of 
                         my circuits or gears will help, I'll 
                         gladly donate them.

<strong>                                     LUKE
</strong>                         He'll be all right.

<strong>               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN THRONE ROOM
</strong>
               Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main 
               temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners 
               are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the 
               beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly 
               march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From 
               one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired 
               Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to 
               an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the 
               whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other 
               dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is 
               dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.  
               She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He 
               winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who 
               is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled 
               troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo 
               beeps with happiness.

</strong>
<strong>               END CREDITS OVER STARS
</strong>
<strong>                                         THE END

<p>Bee Movie Script &#8211; Dialogue Transcript    According to all known laws of aviation,    there is no way a bee should be able to fly.    Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.    The bee, of course, flies anyway    because bees don&#8217;t care what humans think is impossible.    Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.    Ooh, black and yellow! Let&#8217;s shake it up a little.    Barry! Breakfast is ready!    Coming!    Hang on a second.    Hello?    &#8211; Barry? &#8211; Adam?    &#8211; Can you believe this is happening? &#8211; I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;ll pick you up.    </p>



<p>Looking sharp.    Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.    Sorry. I&#8217;m excited.    Here&#8217;s the graduate. We&#8217;re very proud of you, son.    A perfect report card, all B&#8217;s.    Very proud.    Ma! I got a thing going here.    &#8211; You got lint on your fuzz. &#8211; Ow! That&#8217;s me!    </p>



<p>&#8211; Wave to us! We&#8217;ll be in row 118,000. &#8211; Bye!    Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!    &#8211; Hey, Adam. &#8211; Hey, Barry.    &#8211; Is that fuzz gel? &#8211; A little. Special day, graduation.    Never thought I&#8217;d make it.    Three days grade school, three days high school.    Those were awkward.    Three days college. I&#8217;m glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.    You did come back different.    </p>



<p>&#8211; Hi, Barry. &#8211; Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.    &#8211; Hear about Frankie? &#8211; Yeah.    &#8211; You going to the funeral? &#8211; No, I&#8217;m not going.    Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.   </p>



<p> Don&#8217;t waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.    I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.    I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.    That&#8217;s why we don&#8217;t need vacations.    Boy, quite a bit of pomp&#8230; under the circumstances.    &#8211; Well, Adam, today we are men. &#8211; We are!    &#8211; Bee-men. &#8211; Amen!    Hallelujah!    Students, faculty, distinguished bees,    please welcome Dean Buzzwell.   </p>



<p> Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of&#8230;    &#8230;9:15.    That concludes our ceremonies.    And begins your career at Honex Industries!    Will we pick our job today?    I heard it&#8217;s just orientation.    Heads up! Here we go.    Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.    &#8211; Wonder what it&#8217;ll be like? &#8211; A little scary.    </p>



<p>Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco    and a part of the Hexagon Group.    This is it!    Wow.    Wow.    We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life    to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.</p>
