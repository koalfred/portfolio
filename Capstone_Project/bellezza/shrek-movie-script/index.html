But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only  be broken by love&#8217;s first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing  dragon. Many brave knigts had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison,  but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon&#8217;s keep in the highest room of the tallest  tower for her true love and true love&#8217;s first kiss. {Laughing}  Like that&#8217;s ever gonna happen. {Paper Rusting, Toilet Flushes} What a load of &#8211;  Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me I ain&#8217;t the sharpest tool in the shed She was lookin&#8217; kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb In the shape of an &#8220;L&#8221; on her forehead The years start comin&#8217; and they don&#8217;t stop comin&#8217; Fed to the rules and hit the ground runnin&#8217; Didn&#8217;t make sense not to live for fun Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb So much to do so much to see So what&#8217;s wrong with takin&#8217; the backstreets You&#8217;ll never know if you don&#8217;t go You&#8217;ll never shine if you don&#8217;t glow Hey, now You&#8217;re an all-star Get your game on, go play Hey, now You&#8217;re a rock star Get the show on, get paid And all that glitters is gold Only shootin&#8217; stars break the mold It&#8217;s a cool place and they say it gets colder You&#8217;re bundled up now but wait till you get older But the meteor men beg to differ Judging by the hole in the satellite picture The ice we skate is gettin&#8217; pretty thin The water&#8217;s getting warm so you might as well swim My world&#8217;s on fire How &#8217;bout yours That&#8217;s the way I like it and I&#8217;ll never get bored Hey, now, you&#8217;re an all-star {Shouting} Get your game on, go play Hey, now You&#8217;re a rock star Get the show on, get paid And all that glitters is gold Only shootin&#8217; stars break the mold {Belches} Go!

Let&#8217;s get it! -Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? -Yeah, it&#8217;ll grind your bones for it&#8217;s bread. {Laughs} -Yes, well, actually, that would be a gaint. Now, ogres &#8211; &#8211; They&#8217;re much worse. They&#8217;ll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. -No! -They&#8217;ll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it&#8217;s quite good on toast. -Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! {Gasping} -Right. {Roaring} {Shouting} {Roaring} {Whispers} This is the part where you run away. {Gasping} {Laughs} {Laughing} And stay out! &#8220;Wanted. Fairy tale creatures.&#8221; {Sighs} {Man&#8217;s voice} All right. This one&#8217;s full. -Take it away! {Gasps} -Move it along. Come on! Get up! -Next! -Give me that! Your fiying days are over. That&#8217;s 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next! -Get up! Come on! -Twenty pieces. {Thudding} -Sit down there! -Keep quiet! {Crying} -This cage is too small. -Please, don&#8217;t turn me in. I&#8217;ll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance! -Oh, shut up. -Oh! -Next! -What have you got? -This little wooden puppet. -I&#8217;m not a puppet. I&#8217;m a real boy. -Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. -Father, please! Don&#8217;t let them do this! -Help me! -Next! What have you got? -Well, I&#8217;ve got a talking donkey. {Grunts} -Right. Well, that&#8217;s good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. -Oh, go ahead, little fella. -Well? -Oh, oh, he&#8217;s just &#8211; &#8211; He&#8217;s just a little nervous. He&#8217;s really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt &#8211; &#8211; -That&#8217;s it. I&#8217;ve heard enough. Guards! -No, no, he talks! He does. I can talk. I love to talk. I&#8217;m the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. -Get her out of my sight. -No, no!</p><p> I swear! Oh! He can talk! {Gasps} -Hey! I can fly! -He can fly! -He can fly! -He can talk! -Ha, ha! That&#8217;s right, fool! Now I&#8217;m a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain&#8217;t never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! Oh-oh. {Grunts} -Seize him! -After him! He&#8217;s getting away! {Grunts, Gasps} {Man} -Get him! This way! Turn! -You there. Orge! -Aye? -By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under  arrest and transport you to a designated&#8230;.. resettlement facility. -Oh, really? You and what army? {Gasps, Whimpering} {Chuckles} -Can I say something to you? -Listen, you was really, really, really somethin&#8217; back here.  Incredible! Are you talkin&#8217; to &#8211; &#8211; me? Whoa! -Yes. I was talkin&#8217; to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great  back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They  was trippin&#8217; over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made  me feel good to see that. -Oh, that&#8217;s great. Really. -Man, it&#8217;s good to be free. -Now, why don&#8217;t you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends?  Hmm? -But, uh, I don&#8217;t have any friends. And I&#8217;m not goin&#8217; out there by  myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I&#8217;ll stick with you.  You&#8217;re mean, green, fightin&#8217; machine. Together we&#8217;ll scare the spit  out of anybody that crosses us. {Roaring} -Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don&#8217;t mind me sayin&#8217;, if that  don&#8217;t work, your breath certainly will get the job done, &#8217;cause you  definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, &#8217;cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time &#8211; &#8211;  {Mumbling} Than I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases eking out of my  butt that day. -Why are you following me? -I&#8217;ll tell you why.  &#8216;Cause I&#8217;m all alone There&#8217;s no one here beside me My promlems have all gone There&#8217;s no one to deride me But you gotta heve friends &#8211; &#8211;  -Stop singing! It&#8217;s no wonder you don&#8217;t have any friends. -Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest. -Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? -Uh &#8211; &#8211; Really tall? -No! I&#8217;m an orge! You know. &#8220;Grab your torch and pitchforks.&#8221; Doesn&#8217;t  that bother you? -Nope. -Really? -Really, really. -Oh. -Man, I like you. What&#8217;s you name? -Uh, Shrek. -Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don&#8217;t-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. Whoo! Look at that.  Who&#8217;d want to live in place like that? -That would be my home. -Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a  decorator. It&#8217;s amazing what you&#8217;ve done with such a modest budget. I  like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. -I guess you don&#8217;t entertain much, do you? -I like my privacy. -You know, I do too. That&#8217;s another thing we have in common. Like I  hate it when you got somebody in your face. You&#8217;ve trying to give them  a hint, and they won&#8217;t leave. There&#8217;s that awkward silence. -Can I stay with you? -Uh, what? -Can I stay with you, please? -Of course! -Really? -No. -Please! I don&#8217;t wanna go back there! You don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like to  be considered a freak. Well, maybe you do. But that&#8217;s why we gotta  stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! -Okay! Okay! But one night only. -Ah! Thank you! -What are you &#8211; &#8211; No! No! -This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin&#8217; manly stories,  and in the mornin&#8217; I&#8217;m makin&#8217; waffles. -Oh! -Where do, uh, I sleep? -Outside! -Oh, well. I guess that&#8217;s cool. I mean, I don&#8217;t know you, and you  don&#8217;t know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. {Sniffles} -Here I go. -Good night. {Sighs} -I mean, I do like the outdoors. I&#8217;m a donkey. I was born outside.  I&#8217;ll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself,  outside. I&#8217;m all alone There&#8217;s no one here beside me {Bubbling} {Sighs} {Creaking} {Sighs} -I thought I told you to stay outside. -I&#8217;m outside. {Clattering} -Well, gents, it&#8217;s a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we  have?  -It&#8217;s not home, but it&#8217;ll do just fune. -What a lovely bed. -Got ya. {Sniffs} I found some cheese. -Ow! {Grunts} -Blah! Awful stuff. -Is that you, Gorder? -How did you know? -Enough! What are you doing in my house? {Grunts} -Hey! {Snickers} -Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. -Where are we supposed to put her? The bed&#8217;s taken. -Huh? {Gusps} {Male voice} What? -I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I&#8217;m a terrifying orge! What do I  have to do get a little privacy? -Aah! -Oh, no. No! No! {Cackling} -What? -Quit it. -Don&#8217;t push. {Squeaking} {Lows} &#8211; What are you doing in my swamp? {Echoing} Swamp! Swamp! Swamp! {Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let&#8217;s go!  Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! -Quickly. Come on! -No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. -Oh! {Sighs} -Hey, don&#8217;t look at me. I didn&#8217;t invite them. -Oh, gosh, no one invited us. -What? -We were forced to come here. -By who? -Lord Farquaad. -He huffed und he puffed und he&#8230;&#8230; signed an eviction notice. {Sighs} -All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is? {Murmuring} -Oh, I do. I know where he is. -Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? -Me! Me! -Anyone?</p><p> -Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! {Sighs} -Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable.  Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I&#8217;m gonna see this guy  Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came  from! {Cheering} {Twittering} -Oh! You! You&#8217;re comin&#8217; with me. &#8211; All right, that&#8217;s what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two  stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! -On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. -Hey. Oh, oh! -I can&#8217;t wait to get on the road again. -What did I say about singing? -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I hum it? -All right, hum it. {Humming} {Grunts} {Whimpering} -That&#8217;s enough. He&#8217;s ready to talk. {Coughing} {Laughing} {Clears throat} -Run, run, run, as fust as you can. You can&#8217;t catch me. I&#8217;m the  gingerbread man! -You are a monster. -I&#8217;m not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy  tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the  others? -Eat me!{Grunts} -I&#8217;ve tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached  its end! Tell me or I&#8217;ll &#8211; &#8211; -No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. -All right then. Who&#8217;s hiding them? -Okay, I&#8217;ll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? -The muffin man? -The muffin man. -Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? -Well, she&#8217;s married to the muffin man. -The muffin man? -The muffin man! -She&#8217;s married to the muffin man. {Door opens} -My lord! We found it. -Then what are you waiting for? Bring it in. {Man grunting} {Gasping} -Oh! -Magic mirror &#8211; &#8211;  -Don&#8217;t tell him anything! -No! {Ginerbread man whispers} -Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect  kingdom of them all? -Well, technically you&#8217;re not a king. -Uh, Thelonius. -You were saying? -What I mean is, you&#8217;re not a king yet. But you can become one.  All  you have to do is marry a princess. -Go on. {Chuckles} -So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it&#8217;s time for you to  meet today&#8217;s eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette  number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away.  She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking  and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. -Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of  fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she&#8217;s not easy. Just  kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come  on. Give it up for Snow White! -And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a  fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling  lava! But don&#8217;t let that cool you off. She&#8217;s a loaded pistol who likes  pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing,  Princess Fiona! -So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or  bachelorette number three? -Two! Two! -Three! Three! -Two! Two! -Three!  -Three? One? {Shudders} Three? &#8211;Three! Pick number three, my lord! -Okay, okay, uh, number three! -Lord Farquaad, you&#8217;ve chosen Princess Fiona. If you like pina coladas And getting caught in the rain -Princess Fiona. If you&#8217;re not into yoga -She&#8217;s perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go &#8211; &#8211;  -But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. -I&#8217;ll do it. -Yes, but after sunset &#8211; &#8211; -Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will  finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We&#8217;re going to have a tournament. -But that&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s it right there. That&#8217;s DuLoc. I told ya I&#8217;d  find it. -So, that must be Lord Farquaad&#8217;s castle. -Uh-huh. That&#8217;s the place. -Do you think maybe he&#8217;s compensating for something? {Laughs} {Groans} -Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek. -Hurry, darling. We&#8217;re late. Hurry. -Hey, you! {Screams} -Wait a second. Look, I&#8217;m not gonna eat you. I just &#8211; &#8211; I just &#8211; &#8211; {Whimpering} {Sighs} {Whimpering, Groans} {Turnstile clatters} {Chuckles} {Sighs} -It&#8217;s quiet. Too quiet. {Creaking} -Where is everybody? -Hey, look at this! {Clattering, whirring, clicking} Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don&#8217;t make waves, stay in line And we&#8217;ll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your&#8230; face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect &#8230;&#8230; place {Camera shutter clicks {Whirring} -Wow!

You&#8217;re going the right way for a smacked bottom. -Sorry about that. {Cheering} -That champion shall have the honor &#8211; &#8211; no, no &#8211; &#8211; the privilege to go  forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the  dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first  runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you mae  die, but it&#8217;s a sacrifice I am willing to make. {Cheering} -Let the tournament begin! {Gasps} -Oh! -What is that? {Gasping} -It&#8217;s hideous! -Ah, that&#8217;s not very nice. It&#8217;s just a donkey. -Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the orge will be named  champion! Have it him! -Get him! -Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. -Go ahead! Get him! -Can&#8217;t we just settle this over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No? All right then. Come on! I don&#8217;t give a damn about my reputation You&#8217;re living in the past  It&#8217;s a new generation -Damn! {Whinnying} A girl can do what she wants to do And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m gonna do And I don&#8217;t give a damn about my bad reputation Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me Me, me, me -Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! And I don&#8217;t give a damn about my bad reputation Never said I wanted to improve my station -Ah! {Laughs} And I&#8217;m always feelin&#8217; good when I&#8217;m having fun -Yeah! And I don&#8217;t have to please no one -The chair! Give him the chair! And I don&#8217;t give a damn about my bad reputation Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me Me, me, me Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me, not me {Bell dings} {Cheering} {Laughs} -Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I&#8217;m here till  Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! {Shrek laughs} {Crowd gasping, murmuring} -Shall I give the order, sir? -No, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! -What? -Congratulations, orge. You&#8217;re won the honor of embarking on a great  and noble quest. -Quest? I&#8217;m already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. -Your swamp? -Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those tale creatures! {Crowd murmuring} -Indeed. All right, orge. I&#8217;ll make you a deal. Go on this quest for  me, and I&#8217;ll give you your swamp back. -Exactly the way it was? -Down to the last slime-covered toadstool. -And the squatters? -As good as gone. -What kind of quest? -Let me get this straight. You&#8217;re gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a  princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only  don&#8217;t have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. -Is that about right? -Maybe there&#8217;s a good reason donkeys shouldn&#8217;t talk. -I don&#8217;t get it. Why don&#8217;t you just pull some of that orge stuff on  him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make  your bread, the whole orge trip. -Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and  put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and  drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you? -Uh, no, not really, no. -For your information, there&#8217;s a lot more to orges than people think. -Example? -Example? Okay, um, orges are like onions. -{Sniffs} They stink? -Yes &#8211; &#8211; No! -They make you cry? -No! -You leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin&#8217; little  white hairs. -No! Layers! Onions have layers. Orges have layers! Onions have  layers. You get it? We both have layers.  {Sighs} -Oh, you both have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, not everybody likes  onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers. -I don&#8217;t care&#8230; what everyone likes. Orges are not like cakes. -You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a  person, you say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get some parfait,&#8221; they say, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t like  no parfait&#8221;? Parfaits are delicious. -No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Orges are like  onions! And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later. -Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet. -You know, I think I preferred your humming. Do you have a tissure or  something? I&#8217;m making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start  slobbering. I&#8217;m on my way from misery to happiness today Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh I&#8217;m on my way from misery to happiness today Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh And everything that you receive up yonder Is what you give to me the day I wander I&#8217;m on my way  I&#8217;m on my way  I&#8217;m on my way  -Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was  open. Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you&#8217;d be dead. {Sniffs} It&#8217;s  brimstone We must be getting close. -Yeah, right, brimstone. Don&#8217;t be talking about it&#8217;s the brimstone. I  know what I smell. It wasn&#8217;t no brimstone. It didn&#8217;t come off no stone  neither. {Rumbling} -Sure, it&#8217;s big enough, but look at the location. {Laughing} -Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said orges have layers? -Oh, aye. -Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don&#8217;t have  layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves. -Wait a second.  Donkeys don&#8217;t have sleeves.</p><p> -You know what I mean. -You can&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;re afraid of heights. -I&#8217;m just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over  a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey. I&#8217;m right here beside ya, okay? For emotional  support., we&#8217;ll just tackle this thing together one little baby step  at a time. -Really? -Really, really. -Okay, that makes me feel so much better. -Just keep moving. And don&#8217;t look  down. -Okay, don&#8217;t look  down. Don&#8217;t look  down. Don&#8217;t look  down. Keep on  moving. Don&#8217;t look  down. {Gasps} -Shrek! I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; down! Oh, God, I can&#8217;t do this! Just let me off,  please!  -But you&#8217;re already halfway. -But I know that half is safe! -Okay, fine. I don&#8217;t have time for this. You go back. -Shrek, no! Wait! -Just, Donkey &#8211; &#8211; Let&#8217;s have a dance then, shall me? -Don&#8217;t do that! -Oh, I&#8217;m sorry. Do what? -Oh, this? -Yes, that! -Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. {Screams} -No, Shrek! No! Stop it! -You said do it! I&#8217;m doin&#8217; it. -I&#8217;m gonna die. I&#8217;m gonna die. Shrek, I&#8217;m gonna die. Oh! -That&#8217;ll do, Donkey. That&#8217;ll do. -Cool. -So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway? -Inside, waiting for us to rescue her. {Chuckles} -I was talkin&#8217; about the dragon, Shrek. {Water dripping, wind howling} -You afraid? -No. -But &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; Shh. -Oh, good. Me neither. {Gasps} -&#8216;Cause there&#8217;s nothin&#8217; wrong with bein&#8217; afraid. Fear&#8217;s a sensible  response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I  might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and  breathes fire, it sure doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re a coward if you&#8217;re a little  scared. I sure as heck ain&#8217;t no coward. I know that. {Gasps} -Donkey, two things, okay? Shut &#8230; up. Now go over there and see if  you can find any stairs. -Stairs? I thought we was lookin&#8217; for the princess. -The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest  tower. -What makes you think she&#8217;ll be there? -I read it in a book once. -Cool. You handle the dragon. I&#8217;ll handle the stairs. I&#8217;ll find those  stairs. I&#8217;ll whip their butt too. Those stairs won&#8217;t know which way  they&#8217;re goin&#8217;. {Creacing} -I&#8217;m gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don&#8217;t mess with  me. I&#8217;m the stair master. I&#8217;ve mastered the stairs. I wish I had a  step right here. I&#8217;d step all over it. -Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where&#8217;s the &#8211; &#8211;  -Dragon! {Screams} {Gasps} {Roars} -Donkey, look out! {Screams} {Whimpering} -Got ya! {Roars} {Gasps} {Shouts} -Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! {Screaming} {Gasps} -Oh! Aah! Aah! {Gasping} {Crowls} -No. Oh, no, No! {Screams} -Oh, what large teeth you have. {Crowls} -I mean white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all time  from your food, but you must bleach, &#8217;cause that is one dazzling smile  you got  there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness? And you know  what else? You&#8217;re &#8211; &#8211; You&#8217;re a girl dragon!</p><p> Oh, sure! I mean, of  course you&#8217;re a girl dragon. You&#8217;re just reeking of feminine beauty.  What&#8217;s the matter with you? You got something in your eye? Ohh. Oh.  Oh. Man, I&#8217;d really love to stay, but you know, I&#8217;m, uh &#8211; &#8211;  (Coughs) -I&#8217;m an asthmatic, and I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;d work out if you&#8217;re gonna  blow smoke rings. Shrek! {Gasps} {Whimpering} -No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! {Groans, Sighs} {Vocalizing} -Oh! Oh! -Wake up! -What? -Are you Princess Fiona? -I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me. -Oh, that&#8217;s nice. Now let&#8217;s go! -But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be  a wonderful, romantic moment? -Yeah, sorry, lady. There&#8217;s no time. -Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should sweep me off my feet out  yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed. -You&#8217;ve had a lot of time to plan this, haven&#8217;t you? -Mm-hmm. {Screams, grunts} -But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for  me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something! -I don&#8217;t think so. -Can I at least know the name of my champion? -Um, Shrek. -Sir Shrek. {Cleans throat} -I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude. -Thanks! {Roaring} -You didn&#8217;t slay the dragon? -It&#8217;s on my to-do list. Now come on! {Screams} -But this isn&#8217;t right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn,  banner flying. That&#8217;s what all the other knights did. -Yeah, right before they burst into flame. -That&#8217;s not the point. Oh! -Wait. Where are you going? The next&#8217;s over there. -Well, I have to save my ass. -What kind of knight are you? -One of a kind. -Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it&#8217;s healthy to get to  know someone over a long perriod of time. Just call me old-fashioned.  {Laughs} -I don&#8217;t want to rush into a physical relationship. I&#8217;m not  emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this &#8211; &#8211;  Magnitude really  is the word I&#8217;m looking for. Magnitude- &#8211; Hey, that is unwanted  physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let&#8217;s just back  up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to  know each other first as friends or pen pals. I&#8217;m on the road a lot,  but I just love receiving cards &#8211; &#8211;  I&#8217;d really love to stay, but &#8211; &#8211;  Don&#8217;t do that! That&#8217;s my tail! That&#8217;s my personal tail. You&#8217;re gonna  tear it off. I don&#8217;t give permission &#8211; &#8211; What are you gonna do with  that? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no. No! Oh! {Growls} {Roaring} {Gasps} -Hi, Princess! -It talks! -Yeah, it&#8217;s getting him to shut up that&#8217;s the trick. {Screams} {Screaming} -Oh! {Thuds} {Groans} {Roars} {Roaring} -Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I&#8217;ll take care of the dragon. {Fchoing} -Run! {Gasping} {Screaming} {Roaring} {Screams} {Roars} {Panting, sighs} {Whimpers} {Roars} -You did it! -You rescued me! You&#8217;re amazing. You&#8217;re &#8211; &#8211; You&#8217;re wonderful.  You&#8217;re&#8230; a little unorthodox I&#8217;ll admit. But they deed is great, and  thine heart is pure. I am eternally in your debt.  {Clears throat} -And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed? -I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I&#8217;m a  steed. -The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight. -Uh, no. -Why not? -I have helmet hair. -Please.</p><p> I would&#8217;st look upon the face of my rescuer. -No, no, you wouldn&#8217;t &#8211; &#8211; &#8216;st. -But how will you kiss me? -What? That wasn&#8217;t in the job description. -Maybe it&#8217;s a perk. -No, it&#8217;s destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in  a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then  they share true love&#8217;s first kiss. -Hmm? With Shrek? You think- &#8211; Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is you  true love? -Well, yes. {Laughing} -You think Shrek is your true love! -What is so funny? -Let&#8217;s just say I&#8217;m not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are. You&#8217;re my rescuer. Now &#8211; &#8211; Now remove your  helmet. -Look. I really don&#8217;t think this is a good idea. -Just take off the helmet. -I&#8217;m not going to. -Take ot off. -No! -Now! -Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness. -You- &#8211; You&#8217;re a- &#8211; an orge. -Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming. -Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is all wrong. You&#8217;re not supposed  to be an orge. {Sighs} -Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the  one who wants to marry you. -Then why didn&#8217;t he come rescue me? -Good question. You should ask him that when we get there. -But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some prge and his- &#8211;  his pet. -So much for noble steed. -You&#8217;re not making my job any easier. -I&#8217;m sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad  that if he wants to rescue me properly, I&#8217;ll be waiting for him right  here. -Hey! I&#8217;m no one&#8217;s messenger boy, all right? I&#8217;m a delivery boy. -You wouldn&#8217;t dare. Put me down! -Ya comin&#8217;, Donkey? -I&#8217;m right behind ya. -Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not  dignified! Put me down! -Okay, so here&#8217;s another question. Say there&#8217;s a woman that digs you,  right, but you don&#8217;t really like her that way. How do you let her down  real easy so her feelings aren&#8217;t hurt, but you don&#8217;t get burned to a  crisp and eaten? -You just tell her she&#8217;s not your true love. Everyone knowest what  happens when you find your &#8211; &#8211;</p><p> Hey! {Sighs} -The sooner we get to DuLoc the better. -You&#8217;re gonna love it there, Princess. It&#8217;s beautiful! -And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What&#8217;s he like? -Let me put it this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad&#8217;s stature are in  short supply. {Laughs} -I don&#8217;t know. There are those who think little of him. -Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You&#8217;re just jealous you can never  measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Yeah, well, maybe you&#8217;re right, Princess. But I&#8217;ll let you do the  &#8220;measuring&#8221; when you see him tomorrow. -Tomorrow? It&#8217;ll take that long? Shouldn&#8217;t we stop to make camp? -No, that&#8217;ll take longer. We can keep going. -But there&#8217;s robbers in the woods. -Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camping&#8217;s starting to sound good. -Hey, come on. I&#8217;m scarier than anything we&#8217;re going to see in this  forest. -I need to find somewhere to camp now! {Birds wings fluttering} {Grunting} -Hey! Over here. -Shrek, we can do better than that. I don&#8217;t think this is fit for a  princess. -No, no, it&#8217;s perfect. It just needs a few homey touches. -Homey touches? Like what? {Crashing} -A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. -You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will. -I said good night! -Shrek, What are you doing? {Laughs} -I just- &#8211; You know &#8211; &#8211; Oh, come on. I was just kidding. {Fire cracking} -And, uh, that one, that&#8217;s Throwback, the only orge to ever spit over  three wheat fields. Right. Yeah. -Hey, can you tell my future from these stars? -The stars don&#8217;t tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look,  there&#8217;s Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he&#8217;s famous for. -I know you&#8217;re making this up. -No, look. There he is,  and there&#8217;s the group of hunters running away  from his stench. -That ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; but a bunch of little dots. -You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm?  Forget it. {Sighs} -Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway? -Our swamp? -You know, when we&#8217;re through rescuing the princess. -We? Donkey, there&#8217;s no &#8220;we&#8221;. There&#8217;s no &#8220;our&#8221;. There&#8217;s just me and my  swamp. The first thing I&#8217;m gonna do is build a ten-foot wall arond my  land. -You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what  I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody  out. -No, do ya think? -Are you hidin&#8217; something? -Never mind, Donkey. -Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn&#8217;t it? -No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it alone things. -Why don&#8217;t you want to talk about it? -Why do you want to talk about it? -Why are you blocking? -I&#8217;m not blocking. -Oh, yes, you are. -Donkey, I&#8217;m warning you. -Who you trying to keep out? -Everyone! Okay? -Oh, now we&#8217;re gettin&#8217; somewhere. -Oh! For the love of Pete! -What&#8217;s your problem? What you got against the whole world anyway? -Look, I&#8217;m not the one with the problem, okay? It&#8217;s the world that  seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go.</p><p>  &#8220;Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly orge!&#8221; They judge me before they  even know me. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m better off alone. -You know what? When we met, I didn&#8217;t think you was just a big,  stupid, ugly orge. -Yeah, I know. -So, uh, are there any donkeys up there? -Well, there&#8217;s, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying. -Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one  there? -That&#8217;s the moon. -Oh, okay. {Orchestra} {Dulcimer} -Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the  princess. -Hmph. -Ah.

I wanted to  make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me. -Uh, thanks. {Sniffs} -Well, eat up. We&#8217;ve got a big day ahead of us. {Belches} -Shrek! -What? It&#8217;s a compliment.

Can you hear me? -Donkey! -Listen, keep breathing! I&#8217;ll get you out of there! -No! -Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! -Shh. -Shrek! -This is me. {Muffled mumbling} -Princess? What happened to you? You&#8217;re, uh, uh, uh, different. -I&#8217;m ugly, okay? -Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? &#8216;Cause I told Shrek those rats  was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. Now &#8211; &#8211;</p><p>-No. -I &#8211; &#8211; I&#8217;ve been this way as long as I can remember. -What do you mean? Look, I ain&#8217;t never seen you like this before. -It&#8217;s only happens when sun goes down. &#8220;By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm&#8230; until you  find true love&#8217;s first kiss&#8230; and then take love&#8217;s true form.&#8221; -Ah, that&#8217;s beautiful. I didn&#8217;t know you wrote poetry. -It&#8217;s a spell. {Sighs}  -When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I  become this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to  await the day my true love would rescue me. That&#8217;s why I have to marry  Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this. {Sobs} -All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it&#8217;s not that bad. You&#8217;re not  that ugly. Well, I ain&#8217;t gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look  like this at night. Shrek&#8217;s ugly 24-7. -But Donkey, I&#8217;m a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant  to look. -Princess, how &#8217;bout if you don&#8217;t marry Farquaad? -I have to.  Only my true love&#8217;s kiss can break the spell. -But, you know, um, you&#8217;re kind of an orge, and Shrek &#8211; &#8211; well, you  got a lot in common. -Shrek? -Princess, I &#8211; &#8211; Uh, how&#8217;s it going, first of all? Good? Um, good for  me too. I&#8217;m okay. I saw this flower and thought of you because it&#8217;s  pretty and &#8211; &#8211; well, I don&#8217;t really like it, but I thought you might  like it &#8217;cause you&#8217;re pretty. But I like you anyway. I&#8217;d &#8211; &#8211; uh, uh &#8211;  &#8211;  {Sighs} -I&#8217;m in trouble.</p><p>Okay, here we go. -I can&#8217;t just marry whoever I want. Take a good look at me, Donkey. I  mean, really, who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly?  &#8220;Princess&#8221; and &#8220;ugly&#8221; don&#8217;t go together. That&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t stay here  with Shrek. {Gasps} -My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love. {Deep sigh} -Don&#8217;t you see, Donkey? That&#8217;s just how it has to be. It&#8217;s the only  way to break the spell. -You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth. -No!</p><p>You can&#8217;t breathe a word. No one must ever know. -What&#8217;s the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets? -Promise you won&#8217;t tell. Promise! -All right, all right. I won&#8217;t tell him. But you should. I just know  before this is over, I&#8217;m gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy. -Look at my eye twitchin&#8217;. {Door opens} {Snoring}</p><p>-I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him.  -Shrek! Shrek, there&#8217;s something I want &#8211; &#8211;  {Snoring} -Shrek. Are you all right? -Perfect! Never been better. -I &#8211; &#8211; I don&#8217;t &#8211; &#8211; There&#8217;s something I have to tell you. -You don&#8217;t have to tell me anything, Princess. I heard enough last  night. -You heard what I said? -Every word. -I thought you&#8217;d understand. -Oh, I undersatnd. Like you said, &#8220;Who could love a hideous, ugly  beast?&#8221;  -But I thought that wouldn&#8217;t matter to you. -Yeah? Well, it does. {Gasps, sighs} -Ah, right on time. {Horse whinnies} -Princess, I&#8217;ve brought you a little something. {Fanfare} {Yawns} -What&#8217;d I miss? What&#8217;d I miss? {Muffled} -Who said that? Couldn&#8217;t have been a donkey. -Princess Fiona. -As promised. Now hand it over. -Very well, orge. The deed to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed. -Take it and go before I change my mind. -Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I  have never seen such a radiant beauty before. I&#8217;m Lord Farquaad. -Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. {Snaps fingers} -Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying a short&#8230; farewell. -Oh, that is so sweet. You don&#8217;t have to waste good manners on the  orge. It&#8217;s not like it has feelings.</p><p>-No, you&#8217;re right. It doesn&#8217;t. -Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawerss Fiona. I ask your hand in  marriage. {Gasps} -Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom? -Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make &#8211; &#8211;  -Excellent! I&#8217;ll start the plans, for tomorrow we wed! -No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let&#8217;s get married today before the sun  sets. -Oh, anxious, are you? You&#8217;re right. The sooner, the better. There&#8217;s  so much to do! Threre&#8217;s the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest  list. Captain, round up some guests! -Fare-thee-well, orge. -Shrek, what are you doing? You&#8217;re letting her get away. -Yeah? So what? -Shrek, there&#8217;s something about her you don&#8217;t know. Look, I talked to  her last night, She&#8217;s &#8211; &#8211;  -I know you talked to her last night. You&#8217;re great pals, aren&#8217;t ya?  Now, if you two are such good friends, why don&#8217;t you follow her home? -Shrek, I &#8211; &#8211; I wanna go with you. -I told you, didn&#8217;t I? You&#8217;re not coming home with me. I live alone!  My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless,  pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I thought &#8211; &#8211;  -Yeah. You know what?

I forgive you&#8230; for stabbin&#8217; me in  the back! -Ohh!

All she  ever do was like you, maybe even love you. -Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of  you talking.  -She wasn&#8217;t talkin&#8217; about you. She was talkin&#8217; about, uh, somebody  else. -She wasn&#8217;t talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about? -Uh-uh, no way. I ain&#8217;t saying anything.

I need to talk to you. -Oh, now you wanna talk? It&#8217;s a little late for that, so if you&#8217;ll  excuse me &#8211; &#8211;  -But you can&#8217;t marry him. -And why not? -Because- &#8211; Because he&#8217;s just marring you so he can be king. -Outrageous! Fiona, don&#8217;t listen to him. -He&#8217;s not your true love. -And what do you know about true love? -Well, I &#8211; &#8211; Uh &#8211; &#8211; I mean &#8211; &#8211;  -Oh, this is precious.
