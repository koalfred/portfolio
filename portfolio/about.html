    <h1>About</h1>
    <div class="about-content">
    <p>Hello everybody! My name is Alfred Ko and I am a Vancouver-based front-end web developer. I have graduated from the TWD (Technical Web Designer) Program at BCIT. Before entering this program, I obtained my BA in Speech Sciences at UBC, but I felt that I wanted a career change. After pulling up Codecademy one day and trying out their HTML and CSS course out of curiosity, I really got into coding, and when I discovered that there was such a field that uses coding called “web development”, that was when I felt really sold on it. I love not only the problem solving aspect of the field, but with coding you can also enrich the visual outlook and browsing experience of websites as well.</p> 
    <p>I have been working in teams for various projects during theTWD Program, so the program has allowed me to become a bettercommunicator, and a more co-operative person. I also aim to useall that I learned to make sure that clients get the mostbeautiful, dynamic and innovative websites as possible.</p>
    <p>When I am not at work, you can find me swimming, jogging, running, or casually picking up a new language.</p>
    <p>Thank you, and I hope to hear from you soon!</p>
