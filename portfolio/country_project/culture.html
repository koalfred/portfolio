    <p>When you go to another country, the one thing that I can imagine would shock you would be how different the culture would be to your home country. Korea is no exception. Even so, it is a good idea to learn more about the local culture before your trip. Here are a few quick tips to get you started.</p>

    <h2>Social</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>When you greet people, it is polite to start the greeting in Korean <strong>"an-yong-ha-se-yo"</strong>. Unlike in most parts of the world you do <strong>not</strong> shake hands with the person you meet. Rather, you bow at an angle of around 45 degrees. 
        </li>
        <li>Always take off your shoes before you enter a household.</li>
        <li>When you receive an object, like in most Asian countries, it is polite to accept the gift with both hands.</li>
        <li>Never touch or pat a person you do not know. Koreans often value personal space.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Dining</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Before you begin a meal, you say <strong>"chal-mok-ges-sum-ni-nida"</strong>, which literally means, "I shall eat well". It is kind of similar to the phrase "Bon appetit", though there is no exact translation into English. When you finish a meal, you say <strong>"chal-mo-gos-sum-ni-da"</strong>, which literally means, "I ate well". English does not have a particular phrase corresponding to this, though it is similar to "Thanks for the meal."</li>
        <li>Do not leave chopsticks sticking up in food bowls. This is considered extremely rude, as it looks as if you are offering food to deceased people.</li>
        <li>When dining in groups, Koreans do not pour their own drink, but offer to pour for others. You should offer to do this too.</li>
        <li>It is normal to argue for the bill in groups. Most Koreans do not split the bill, but one person often offers to pay the whole bill.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Superstitions</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Most Koreans do not like the number 4, as it sounds similar to the Chinese character for "death". Avoid giving items or gifts in numbers of 4.</li>
        <li>Do not write people's names in red ink. This is also believed as a death wish.</li>
    </ul>
