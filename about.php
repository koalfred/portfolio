                <div class="about-content">
                <p>Hello everybody! My name is Alfred Ko and I am a Canada-based front-end web developer and an aspiring data analyst.</p>
                <p>I have 2 years of experience in IT. I first started my journey in web development after graduating from the Technical Web Designer Program (TWD) at the British Columbia Institute of Technology. Before entering this program, I obtained my Bachelor of Arts in Speech Sciences at the University of British Columbia, but I felt that I wanted a career change. After pulling up Codecademy one day and trying out their HTML and CSS course out of curiosity, I really got into coding, and when I discovered that there was such a field that uses coding called “web development”, that was when I felt really sold on it. I love not only the problem solving aspect of the field, but with coding you can also enrich the visual outlook and browsing experience of websites as well. I continued to work for different organizations around Canada, helping their organizations achieve the most innovative, modern and user-friendly websites for their brands.</p> 
                <p>Recently, I have been studying data analysis with Treehouse. I wanted to expand my potential career options that the field of IT has to offer, and my interest in IT combined with math and statistics led me to study data analysis. I am really enjoying this field because of the thrill that I get when working with data and numbers, as well as the ability to program different visual and analytical reports.</p>
                <p>When I am not at work, you can find me working out at the gym, swimming, drawing, playing chess or casually picking up a new language.</p>
                <p>Thank you, and I hope to hear from you soon!</p>
